This National Clinical Guideline (NCG), has been developed by the Sepsis Guideline Development Group (GDG), within
the HSE National Sepsis Programme (NSP). The National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) was requested by
the Minister for Health to commission the 2014 guideline arising from a significant patient safety/policy matter.


The Guideline in Sepsis Management for Adults (including maternity) was revised in September 2021. Following
discussion between the National Clinical Programme (NCP) for Sepsis and the National Clinical Effectiveness
Committee (NCEC) a decision was taken in 2025 to proceed with a rapid update incorporating the Surviving Sepsis
Campaign Guidelines (SSCG 2021).


**Scope of the Rapid Update 2025**

A rapid update to National Clinical Guideline (NCG, No.26), Sepsis Management for Adults (including Maternity) (DoH,
2021), was undertaken by a sepsis guideline review team in November 2024 to incorporate five key recommendations
from the SSCG 2021. The National Sepsis Programme convened key stakeholders and recognised experts in sepsis
management to undertake this work. A literature search was undertaken by the HSE Library Service to identify any
additional research evidence published since the SSCG 2021 to support this rapid update. No new practice changing
research evidence was identified from the peer reviewed evidence since the publication of SSCG 2021.


While this guideline rapid update incorporates the most relevant aspects of the SSCG 2021 guidelines that were not
previously reflected in NCG No. 26, a comprehensive review and full revision of NCG No. 26 will be undertaken in due
course. Therefore, we have not changed the numerical order of the existing recommendations. This rapid update (2025)
affects recommendations 11 and 16 (changed), 16a, 38a and 48a (new), and updated guidance on the structure and
governance of acute hospital sepsis committees (3.1.1).


Recommendations which are new or have been updated can be recognised by the addition of the text ‘ **[updated 2025]** ’
or ‘ **[new 2025]** ’ following each updated or new recommendation. Minor editorial changes have been made throughout.


**Using this National Clinical Guideline**

- This NCG applies to all adult patients, including pregnant women and women in the postnatal period up to 42
days, in the acute hospital sector.

- All maternity specific information is highlighted using purple text.

- This NCG does not apply to paediatric patients up to the age of 16 years (HSE, 2016).

- This NCG is relevant to all healthcare professionals working in the acute hospital sector.

- This NCG is an adoption of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline (SSCG) (Rhodes et al. 2016). The wording
of the recommendations have not been changed from the SSCG publication, with the exception of units of
measurement applicable to the Irish context.

- Recognising that much of the research that informed the SSCG occurred in the critical care setting, the GDG
provides Implementation Points after the SSCG recommendations to aid the implementation of the guideline
within the Irish healthcare system and are aimed, primarily, at the pre- and post-critical care setting.

- All SSCG references are numbered.

- Additional references, that are included with the implementation points, are in a separate reference list
called National Clinical Guideline References and are listed alphabetically.

**Credits**
The role of the NCEC is to prioritise, quality assure and recommend clinical guidelines to the Chief Medical
Officer for endorsement by the Minister for Health. It is intended through Ministerial endorsement that full
implementation of the guideline will occur through the relevant service plans.


The NCEC and the Department of Health acknowledge and recognise the Chair and members of the
Guideline Development Group (GDG) for development of the guideline. The NCEC and Department of
Health wish to express thanks and sincere gratitude to all persons contributing to this National Clinical
Guideline; especially those that give of their time on a voluntary basis.


**Acknowledgments**

Sepsis is a common and time dependent medical emergency. It can affect any person of any age, from any
social background and can strike irrespective of underlying good health or concurrent medical condition.
This National Clinical guideline is intended to be relevant to all healthcare staff involved in the care of
patients with sepsis and the suspicion of sepsis in the Republic of Ireland.


The **Surviving Sepsis Campaign** (SSC) is a global initiative which brings together professional organizations
with the aim of reducing mortality from sepsis. The purpose of the SSC is to create an international
collaborative effort to improve the treatment of sepsis and reduce the high mortality rate associated with
the condition. The SSC published guidelines for Managing Sepsis and Septic Shock in 2012, and then in
2015, a consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organisations was


**v** **| Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** | National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2


convened. The SSCG panel provided 93 statements on early management and resuscitation of patients with
sepsis or septic shock.


The NSP is very grateful to the SSC for their kind permission to adopt the SSCG as the Irish National Clinical
Guideline on Sepsis Management.


We also wish to acknowledge all the members of the National Sepsis Steering Committee (Appendix 2) and
the Guideline Development Group (Table 1) who gave freely of their time and expertise. A special word
of thanks to the external experts, Professor Kevin Rooney, National Clinical Lead on Sepsis, Healthcare

**National Clinical Guidelines**
Providing standardised clinical care to patients in healthcare is challenging. This is due to a number of
factors, among them variations in environments of care and complex patient presentations. It is self-evident
that safe, effective care and treatment are important in ensuring that patients get the best outcomes from
their care.


The Department of Health is of the view that supporting evidence-based practice, through the clinical
effectiveness framework, is a critical element of the health service to deliver safe and high-quality care.
The National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) is a Ministerial committee set up in 2010 as a key
recommendation of the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance (2008). The
establishment of the Commission was prompted by an increasing awareness of patient safety issues in
general and high-profile health service system failures at home and abroad.


The NCEC on behalf of the Department of Health has embarked on a quality assured National Clinical
Guideline development process linked to service delivery priorities. Furthermore, implementing National
Clinical Guidelines sets a standard nationally, to enable healthcare professionals to deliver safe and effective
care and treatment while monitoring their individual, team and organisation’s performance.


The aim of NCEC National Clinical Guidelines is to reduce unnecessary variations in practice and provide
an evidence base for the most appropriate healthcare, in particular circumstances. As a consequence
of Ministerial mandate, it is expected that NCEC National Clinical Guidelines are implemented across all
relevant services in the Irish healthcare setting.


The NCEC is a partnership between key stakeholders in patient safety. NCEC’s mission is to provide a
framework for national endorsement of clinical guidelines and clinical audit to optimise patient and service
user care. The NCEC has a remit to establish and implement processes for the prioritisation and quality
assurance of clinical guidelines and clinical audit so as to recommend them to the Minister for Health to
become part of a suite of National Clinical Guidelines and National Clinical Audit. The aim of the suite of
National Clinical Guidelines is to provide guidance and standards for improving the quality, safety and costeffectiveness of healthcare in Ireland. The implementation of these National Clinical Guidelines will support
the provision of evidence-based and consistent care across Irish healthcare services.

###### **2 Development of the National Clinical Guideline**

**2.1 Background**

Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection (Singer et
al., 2016). International estimates of incidence vary and despite declining age-standardised incidence and
mortality, sepsis remains a major cause of health loss worldwide (Rudd et al., 2020). This study found that
there were 48.9 million cases of sepsis in 2017 resulting in 11 million deaths worldwide, confirming that
the actual rates are double than previously estimated, and that 20 per cent of global deaths are due to this
under-reported but deadly medical condition. Information on the National Sepsis Programme and statistics
on sepsis in Ireland are available at https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/cspd/ncps/sepsis/resources/


**2.1.1 Definitions**

It is recognised that in recent years, confusion has arisen with the changing definitions of sepsis and septic
shock and the use of SIRS criteria. The understanding of sepsis has evolved over the years and as such so
have the definitions (Table 3).

*** Sepsis 1** refers to the 1st consensus definition (Bone et al., 1992)

****Sepsis 2** refers to the 2nd consensus definition (Levy et al., 2003) (Dellinger et al., 2008) (Martin, 2012)

*****Sepsis 3** refers to the 3rd consensus definition (Rhodes et al., 2017)


**16** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



The NCG has adopted the Sepsis 3 definition and the rationale are outlined below.

**Sepsis 6** is the name given to a bundle of medical therapies designed to reduce mortality in patients with sepsis
(Take 3 and Give 3). Sepsis 6 was developed by The UK Sepsis Trust (Daniels et al., 2011) as a practical tool to
help healthcare professionals deliver the SSCG 1 hour bundle.

**Sepsis 6 + 1** is the same as Sepsis 6 but + 1 refers to Fetal wellbeing. Resuscitating the mother will resuscitate
the baby, however, it is important to assess fetal wellbeing and formulate a plan for delivery if required. Maternal
sepsis with or without haemodynamic instability may present with fetal distress as the uteroplacental circulation
is not auto-regulated (Chau, 2014). Thus any maternal circulatory insufficiency arising from sepsis may result in
compromised fetal perfusion.


**2.1.1.1 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)**

Much has been made of the removal of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria from
the definition of sepsis. However, this does not mean that SIRS have ‘gone away’. It reflects the fact that selflimiting non-life-threatening infections may present with SIRS and that SIRS may be caused by infectious and
non-infectious insults. The criteria for a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) are fulfilled when 2 or more of
the following are present (Bone et al., 1992).


**Adult non-pregnant**

 - Heart rate > 90 beats/minute

 - Respiratory rate > 20 breaths/minute

 - Temperature > 38.3°C or < 36°C

 - White cell count > 12 or < 4 x 109 cells/L or normal with > 10% immature forms

 - Bedside glucose >7.7mmol/L in the absence of diabetes mellitus.

**Maternity: Modified SIRS for women, pregnant and up to 42 days in the postnatal period.** Physiological
changes must be sustained not transient.

 - Heart rate ≥ 100 beats/minute (Carlin, 2008, Hayes, 2012, Soma-Pillay et al., 2016)

 - Respiratory rate ≥ 20 breathes/minute

 - Temperature > 38°C or < 36°C (NWIHP, 2019, NCEC, 2019)

 - White cell count > 16.9 or < 4 x 109 cells/L or > 10% immature bands

 - Blood sugar level > 7.7 mmol/L (in the non-diabetic)

 - Acutely altered mental status

 - Fetal heart Rate > 160 bpm
The rationale behind the shift away from the SIRS-based definition of sepsis (Sepsis 2) is primarily three-fold.

 - The over-sensitivity of the previous definition that included a cohort of patients who did not have a lifethreatening illness and whose clinical course would not be impacted by escalated care (Churpek et al.,
2015), (Comstedt et al., 2009).

 - Its failure to recognise patients with a life-threatening acute organ dysfunction due to infection that would
benefit from escalated care but who did not present with a SIRS response (Comstedt et al., 2009), (Kaukonen
et al., 2015).

 - The lack of specificity of the SIRS response that can be triggered by many non-infective insults (Thoeni,
2012).
Whilst the presence of a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) is helpful in diagnosing infection, it is no longer
a requirement for the diagnosis of sepsis, (Singer et al., 2016).


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **17**


**2.1.1.2 Sepsis definitions for this NCG**

**Sepsis** is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (Singer et al.,
2016).

**Maternal sepsis** is a life-threatening condition defined as organ dysfunction resulting from infection during
pregnancy, childbirth, post-abortion or postpartum period (WHO, 2017).

The clinical application of this latest definition requires that there be evidence to support infection as the cause
of the patient being unwell based on history, examination and clinical or biochemical evidence of acute organ
dysfunction consequent to that infection. The guideline recognises that there is no single test that confirms the
presence of infection or sepsis but rather the diagnosis is based on the presence of a suite of symptoms and
signs supported by tests and investigations. It also recognises that whilst the identification of a pathological
organism is very valuable in guiding treatment, that blood cultures are only positive in 40-55% of cases (Martin
et al., 2003), (Brun-Buisson et al., 1995), and in some cases even lower (Coburn et al., 2012) (Jones and Lowes,
1996), and that a negative culture does not preclude the diagnosis of infection or sepsis.


**2.1.1.3 Septic Shock definition**

**All adults**

**Septic shock** is a subset of sepsis with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction associated with a higher
risk of mortality (Singer et al., 2016). The sepsis definition taskforce has defined this as the requirement for
vasopressors/ inotropes to achieve a mean arterial pressure of ≥ 65mmHg AND a lactate > 2mmols/l despite
adequate fluid resuscitation (Singer et al., 2016). The rationale behind this definition is to identify the cohort
of patients with a mortality risk of > 40% for the purposes of international comparison. Patients with a
vasopressor requirement and normal lactate post resuscitation have a mortality risk of > 30% (Singer et al.,
2016).


Patients who require vasopressors or inotropes to maintain adequate perfusion pressure post fluid resuscitation
require critical care whether their lactate is raised or not. For this reason, this NCG uses the persistent
requirement for vasopressors/inotropes post adequate fluid resuscitation as its definition of septic shock. This
is a pragmatic decision for the purposes of facilitating clinical care, recognizing that lactate measurement is not
always available and that the sepsis definition taskforce allowed for this:


‘In settings in which lactate measurement is not available, the use of a working diagnosis of septic shock
using hypotension and other criteria consistent with tissue hypoperfusion (e.g. delayed capillary refill) may be
necessary’ (Singer et al., 2016).

**2.1.1.4. Criteria to support diagnosis of sepsis.**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



To assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing sepsis and septic shock, criteria outlined in Table 4 have been
developed.

**Table 4.** Summary of diagnostic criteria used by the NCG

|Infection|A clinical syndrome based on symptoms and signs<br>caused by pathological organisms, which may or<br>may not be identified.|
|---|---|
|**Sepsis**|One or more acute organ dysfuncton consequent to<br>infecton.<br>Of note this was formerly defned as “Severe sepsis”.<br>When used now, severe sepsis is a descriptve<br>term rather than a defniton much like severe<br>pneumonia.|
|**Septc shock**|A vasopressor or inotrope requirement to maintain<br>mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65mmHg despite<br>adequate fuid resuscitaton which has been<br>triggered by infecton.|



**What is the impact of sepsis in Ireland?**

In 2018, sepsis or septic shock was documented in 14,639 non-pregnant adults and these patients had a
mortality rate of 20.3% (HSE, 2019b). There were 12,005 patients, with a sepsis diagnosis, who were assigned
to a medical diagnostic related group (DRG), and these patients had an average length of stay (AvLOS) of 17.1
days, which is 49.6% longer than those who had a diagnosis of infection. Medical patients with a hospital stay
complicated by sepsis had a mortality rate of 19.4%. 2,634 patients were assigned to a surgical DRG and they
had an AvLOS of 46.4 days, 127% longer than those with an infection diagnosis. Surgical patients whose hospital
stay was complicated by sepsis had a mortality rate of 24.8%. 31.7% of all hospital inpatients were documented
as having an infection or sepsis as part of their discharge diagnoses and they occupied 49.4% of the acute
hospital beds.


Sepsis affected 3.33% of inpatients but contributed to 27% of all hospital deaths, a documentation rate of 303
cases per 100,000 population per annum. In 2017, chart review audits were performed by the Sepsis Group
Assistant Directors of Nursing (ADONS) on 523 charts nationally. Charts were sampled from all acute hospitals
and included patients with infection and acute kidney injury cared for by medical physicians, surgeons and
emergency medicine physicians. This audit demonstrated that only 52% of cases that fulfilled the criteria for
sepsis were actually documented as sepsis, applying this rate to national figures would lead to sepsis affecting
up to 6.7% of hospital inpatients or approximately 583 per 100,000 population per annum. This is consistent
with other jurisdictions that have published data based on administrative databases (Angus et al., 2001).


Three highly publicised maternal deaths have occurred in Ireland since 2007 identifying failings around
assessment, monitoring and recognition of sepsis and septic shock. Mortality from maternal sepsis from direct
causes is currently 0.5% (HSE, 2019b) and 0.44 per 100,000 maternities (Knight M, 2019). The Irish data is based
on the number of women who developed sepsis in Ireland during 2018 (HSE, 2019b).


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **19**


**Table 5.** Definitions of maternal deaths: (WHO 2010)


MATERNAL DEATH Deaths of women while pregnant or within 42 days of the end
of the pregnancy* from any cause related to or aggravated by
the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or
incidental causes.


Direct Deaths resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant
state (pregnancy, labour and puerperium), from interventions,
omissions, incorrect treatment or from a chain of events
resulting from any of the above.


Indirect Deaths resulting from previous existing disease, or disease that
developed during pregnancy, and which was not the result
of direct obstetric causes, but which was aggravated by the
physiological effects of pregnancy


Late Deaths occurring more than 42 days but less than 1 year after
the end of pregnancy.


Coincidental [‡] Incidental/accidental deaths not due to pregnancy or
aggravated by pregnancy


  - Includes giving birth, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage or termination of pregnancy.


  - Termed ‘’Fortuitous’’ in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)


**Why is the pre-critical care setting important?**

The Centres for Disease Control (CDC) in the U.S. have identified that 70-80% of sepsis cases arise in the
community (CDC, 2016, NCEC, 2013). These patients present to the acute hospital sector via the emergency
department (ED), the Acute Medical Unit (AMU), the Acute Surgical Assessment Unit (ASAU) and to a lesser
extent the outpatient department (OPD). The remaining 20-30% of patients deteriorate with sepsis as an
inpatient.


In order for patients to have the best opportunity to survive they need to present for medical review and have
sepsis recognised and managed in an appropriate and timely manner. There is an important role for primary and
community care in terms of risk recognition and for public awareness of the signs and symptoms of deterioration
that may signal the development of sepsis, in order to ensure the right patient is in the right place at the right
time to receive the right treatment; however, this is outside the remit of this guideline.


It is recognised that the presentation of sepsis is variable in symptoms, signs and time course. Thus, sepsis may
not be present or not be diagnosed on first presentation and may not become apparent until the clinical condition
evolves further. Deterioration whilst on treatment (including supportive) needs to be reviewed and diagnosis
and treatment amended accordingly. The Irish National Early Warning System (2020) (INEWS) combined with
clinical judgment should be deployed to recognise and respond to deterioration in the in-patient.


The Irish Maternity Early Warning System (IMEWS), (NCEC, 2019) combined with clinical judgement, should be
deployed to detect deterioration in the pregnant woman.

**2.2 Clinical and financial impact of condition/disease/topic**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



A literature search was undertaken by the HSE Library Service to identify any economic literature published
since the previous Sepsis NCG was published in 2014. The methodology is provided in Appendix 4.


The programme uses the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) database to extract data on the burden of sepsis in
the acute hospital sectors and to identify the common characteristics of patients with sepsis.
The methodology uses specific HIPE codes which are based on ICD-10-AM. Appendix 5 describes the coding
process and a list of the codes used for the extraction can be found in the annual Sepsis report 2018.


There are a number of limitations to using this dataset:

 - Causality cannot be inferred from administrative data.

 - Sepsis may be a direct or indirect contributor to morbidity and mortality.

 - In patients admitted to critical care, the sepsis event may be unrelated to the cause of critical care
admission and indeed may not have occurred during the critical care stay.


The reasons contributing to the above include:

 - Sepsis is not routinely coded as the main diagnosis.

 - There is no order of precedence in the subsequent diagnostic and procedural codes dx 2-30.


For example, a patient admitted for treatment of lymphoma might develop neutropenic sepsis and end up in an
intensive care unit (ICU). Their main diagnosis, dx1, is likely to be coded as lymphoma and sepsis could appear
anywhere in dx2-30, as will the ICU stay.


Another patient might be admitted electively for a surgical procedure with routine post-operative ICU admission,
subsequently, on the ward, they develop sepsis but do not require or no critical care bed is available, and they
have a prolonged hospital stay. Their dx1 will be the reason for the surgical procedure with sepsis anywhere
between dx2-30, as will the ICU stay.


In the first example sepsis is clearly the cause of deterioration and ICU admission, in the second the sepsis
episode is unrelated to the ICU admission but has clearly contributed to morbidity. In both cases the sepsis
episode has had a profound effect on the patient and the healthcare costs.

Despite its limitations the use of administrative data has been validated for quality improvement programmes
(Aylin et al., 2007).


In 2018, there were 14,639 patients who had sepsis included in their discharge coding. 4,002 of these patients
required admission to a critical care bed at some point during their hospitalisation (HSE, 2019b).


The economic impact of sepsis can be looked at by assessing:

 - Direct costs

 - Economic and social burden

 - ‘Loss of wages technique’
**Direct:**
The average cost per in-patient stay per night in 2017 (latest data available) was €878, (HPO, 2018). This cost
is not specific to sepsis patients. It is the average cost of an inpatient stay per night when all diagnoses are
included. Sepsis is acknowledged as one of the more expensive inpatient diagnosis (Pfuntner A., 2013), so this
analysis is at risk of underestimating the costs of sepsis care in the Irish acute hospital sector.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **21**


Table 6 describes the healthcare usage of patients with sepsis, both medical and surgical, and the difference, in
terms of numbers of patients, number of bed days, average length of stay (AvLOS) and cost between this cohort
and the patient with any uncomplicated infection.


The estimated direct costs of patients with sepsis causing or complicating their hospital admission is €288 million
per annum (i.e. €19,667 x 14,639) with an AvLOS of 22.4 days. The difference between the average hospital stay
complicated by infection rather than sepsis is 9.79 days or €8,603 per patient.

The average length of stay for a patient in a surgical diagnostic-related group (DRG) with a sepsis diagnosis is
46.4days with a cost of €40,739. Surgical DRG patients with an infection diagnosis have an AvLOS of 20.4 days, a
difference in cost of €22,828 per patient between sepsis and infection complicating their hospitalisation. This is
a total cost differential of approximately €60 million between surgical patients with sepsis and surgical patients
with any uncomplicated infection (Table 7).

**Economic and Social Burden:**

Silva and Araujo (2009) performed a review to standardise the concepts related to health economic analysis and
provide guidelines for reporting economic analyses that were largely based on the US Public Health Service Panel
on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine (PCEHM) for the conduct and reporting of economic analyses. This
guidance and the methodology deployed by Schmidt were in sufficient detail and used data points available
for the Irish Health Care System to allow them to do a short analysis on the costs incurred by current sepsis
management and potentially saved with performance and quality improvement. The analysis is for descriptive
purposes only.
The costs of sepsis to the economy can be divided into direct costs (28%), loss of productivity due to mortality
(56%), loss of productivity due to morbidity (12%) and loss of productivity due to temporary morbidity (4%)
(Silva and Araujo, 2009).


**Direct** €19,667 (28%)
Loss of productivity due to mortality €39,334 (56%)
Loss of productivity due to morbidity €8,429 (12%)
Temporary loss of productivity €2,810 (4%)
Total costs = €70,240 per patient or €1.03 billion loss to the Irish Economy per annum.


**‘Loss of wages’ method (Mitchell and Bates, 2011)**
An alternative method to estimate the loss of productivity due to mortality, is to use the ‘Loss of wages’ method
(Mitchell and Bates, 2011). This is the most frequently used measure of productivity loss; using a retirement
age of 65 years, there were a total of 12,600 years lost amongst 1,892 patients who died below the age of 65. It
does not include direct costs or productivity loss due to morbidity.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **23**


The average annual earnings in 2016 were €36,919, making a total loss of earnings of €465.2million, with an
estimated income tax loss to the exchequer of €93million. This is lower than the estimated €583.6million using
the previous method above and would result in a total cost of €924 million to the Irish economy per annum.


**Comparisons:**
**Direct costs in ICU versus Non-ICU:**
In the U.S., Angus et al (2009), using the claims databases, estimated the ICU septic patient cost $29,900,
_(€25,652)*_ with an AvLOS 23.3 days versus the non-ICU septic patient $13,900 _(€11,928)*_, with an AvLOS of
15.6 days (Shen et al., 2016). In the same population, the calculated cost differential between survivors and
non-survivors was $38,304 _(€32,870)*_ versus $49,182 _(€42,202)*_ (Chalfin et al., 1995).


In France, costs were reported from €26,256 to €35,185 depending on the severity of illness (Brun-Buisson et
al., 2003). Other European studies have given lower cost estimates, ranging from €23,000 to €29,000 (Burchardi
and Schneider, 2004). In Ireland, a prospective micro-costing of ICU treatment was performed (not limited to
sepsis), with mean total ICU costs of €20,487, (McLaughlin et al., 2009).
In Brazil, a micro-costing analysis of ICU sepsis care showed a median total cost of $9,773 _(€8,386)*_ ($4,643$19,221) _(€3985-€16,499)*_ (Sogayar et al., 2008).  In China, an analysis showed a mean hospital cost $11,390

- $11,455 _(€ 9,777 -9831)*_ per sepsis case (Cheng et al., 2007).


Thus, it can be seen that the hospital costs calculated for Ireland are not out of sync with other high-income
countries, although direct comparisons cannot be made due to the difference in methodology.

**Economic and social burden:**
In Germany in 2002, using the administrative and other databases, Schmidt et al. did an assessment of the
economic and social burden of sepsis (Schmidt et al., 2002). He identified the ratios used in the analysis for
Ireland.
His results include:

 - Productivity loss due to temporary morbidity €3,431 to 7,409 depending on severity (calculated at €2,810
in Ireland).

 - Productivity loss due to mortality €46,000 per case (calculated at €39,334 in Ireland).

 - Total burden of illness €82,886 to €178,954 (calculated at €70,240 per patient in Ireland).


**Economic impact of the National Sepsis Programme**
An economic impact of the sepsis protocol in an academic, tertiary care hospital in the United States found
median total hospital costs were reduced from $21,985 to $16,103, (€18,866 - €13,818)** mainly due to a
shorter length of stay (Shorr et al., 2007).
_**(Currency conversion as of 25th September 2020 by XE currency converter)_


This has also been seen in Ireland where the AvLOS for patients with sepsis causing or complicating their hospital
admission in 2011-2015 was 25.9 with estimated direct costs of €21,437, as this AvLOS fell in 2016/17 to 20.9
this has resulted in a reduction of €3,583 per patient with an estimated direct cost of €17,890 per hospital stay.

In the overall sepsis population, two changes occurred as a consequence of the implementation programme,
improved recognition and improved treatment. In the non-critical care population changes over time will reflect
improved recognition as well as changes due to improved treatment and as such, analysis of trends in this
population are problematic. However, in the critical care population lower acuity would have no impact on
critical care admission due to the limited number of such beds; indeed, there was a decrease in capacity over
the study period suggesting a potential increase in acuity amongst the critical care population.

 - Mean sepsis-associated mortality 2016-2018 in patients admitted to a critical care area: 31.4%


An absolute decrease of 2.6% and a relative decrease of 8%.


In 2018, 4,002 patients admitted to ICU had a sepsis code on their hospital discharge.
The mortality decrease suggests an additional 302 lives saved over the 3 years post implementation from this
subpopulation.
The hospital AvLOS for this subgroup decreased from 36.72 days in 2011-15 to 33.7 days in 2016-18, a gain of
12,086 bed days and a reduction in direct costs from €30,808 to €29,589 per patient. This represents a saving
of €10.6million.


**2.3 Rationale for this National Clinical Guideline**

Sepsis is a common time-dependent medical emergency. Whilst it can affect a person of any age, from any
social background and can strike irrespective of underlying good health, 90% of adults and 70% of children who
develop sepsis have underlying risk factors (CDC, 2016) . International sepsis campaigns that have introduced
and promoted an approach to sepsis care based on early recognition of sepsis with resuscitation and timely
referral to critical care are associated with an increased compliance with sepsis bundles and a decrease in
mortality (Odds Ratio 0.6) (Damiani et al., 2015)


In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) were developed by
a taskforce at the request of the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the European Society of Intensive
Care Medicine (ESICM), (Singer et al., 2016).


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **25**


Sepsis-3 provides a welcome rationalization of the sepsis syndrome with sepsis only being diagnosed when
infection has led to acute organ dysfunction and the presence of a systemic inflammatory response no longer
being a requirement. A systemic inflammatory response may be caused by infective and non-infective conditions
and represents an adaptive response to an insult. It is present in about 85% of sepsis cases and many more cases
that are not sepsis. Thus, although its presence can alert a clinician that a patient may have a problem it is not
sufficiently discriminatory to identify the cause of the problem.


These changes go a good way to reduce concerns about over diagnosis leading to overuse of antibiotics in a
climate of increasing concern about multi-drug resistant organisms by identifying a subset of patients with
infection who have a high mortality risk.


**2.4 Aim and objectives**

**Aims**
1. To ensure that all acute hospitals give patients with sepsis the best opportunity to survive.
2. To maximize the health-related quality of life in survivors of sepsis.
3. To minimize the burden of sepsis to the healthcare system by reducing the acuity and the chronic
sequelae of sepsis.


The National Clinical Guideline for Sepsis Management was published in November 2014 (NCEC, 2014) and the
implementation process started in 2015 with an education and awareness campaign. Hospital-based education
was delivered by the National Sepsis Programme in all acute hospitals and clinical decision support tools and
other educational aids and materials were rolled-out.

**26** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**


**Quarterly data, 2011 – 2018 (Statistical Process Control Chart)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Quarterly rates of in-hospital mortality for inpatients with a diagnosis of sepsis from 2011 to 2018 were analysed
using Statistical Process Control (SPC) methods (Figure 1). The use of SPC methods allows us to see whether the
changes made resulted in improvements and allow us to distinguish between variation that may have happened
by chance alone and variation that indicates a real improvement in mortality rates. There is an important caveat
and that is that the education and awareness campaign will have led to the improved documentation of lower
acuity sepsis cases that bring with them a lower mortality rate and this will have impact.


This figure demonstrates that the National Sepsis Programme had a statistically significant impact on the
recognition and management of sepsis in Ireland. Between 2011 and 2015, the average in-hospital mortality
for inpatients with a diagnosis of sepsis was 23.4%. Using control limits based on SPC methods it was expected
during this period that the quarterly mortality rate would vary from around 20 to 26% by chance alone. Since
2016 the quarterly mortality rate has averaged 18.7% which is below this lower control limit of 20% indicating a
significant improvement in mortality rates that is not explained by chance alone.


The control limits in the statistical process control chart have been re-calculated to reflect this reduction. We
now anticipate that this improvement will be sustained, and mortality will remain below 20% (with some
variation due to seasonal effects) (HSE, 2019b).


It is not possible to distinguish what portion of improvement is due to improved recognition and what is due
to improved management, however, a 7.95% decrease in mortality is also observed in the critical care patient
cohort (Figure 2), where capacity not recognition limits access and where there was a decrease in per capita bed
stock. These effects are consistent with those found in other jurisdictions where sepsis quality improvement
programmes were implemented (Rhodes et al., 2017).













**Figure 2.** Impact of the Sepsis Guideline Implementation in Ireland; sepsis-associated hospital mortality in
inpatients admitted to a critical care area* with a discharge code of Sepsis & SIRS of Infectious origin.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **27**


SPC analysis does not identify which changes resulted in the demonstrated improvement. It is acknowledged
that improved recognition and documentation of lower acuity sepsis cases, as well as improved management
will have contributed to this effect. However, the average mortality rates can be benchmarked against other
jurisdictions that have published (Seymour et al., 2017, Martin et al., 2003, Angus et al., 2001) and this indicates
that Ireland is performing as well as other high-income countries in terms of sepsis-associated mortality rates.


**Objectives**

1. That all healthcare professionals have an understanding of the diagnostic criteria for sepsis and its basic
pathophysiology.

2. That all medical, nursing and midwifery staff working in the acute sector, recognise patients at high risk of
mortality from sepsis.

3. That all medical, nursing and midwifery staff working in the acute sector are:

i. Familiar with the initial management of patients with a high risk of mortality from sepsis
ii. Able to use the sepsis form which is a clinical decision support tool and forms part of the patient’s
clinical notes.
iii. Able to take a team approach to implementing the Sepsis 6 bundle (Daniels et al., 2011) and the
sepsis management algorithms.


**How should the aims and objectives be supported in the community?**

70-80% of sepsis cases arise in the community thus a quality improvement campaign needs to have a 2-fold
approach (CDC, 2016).


1. Address sepsis recognition and management by healthcare professionals who work in the community and

2. Improve Sepsis awareness in the public domain.


There is limited evidence-based data to guide recognition, management and escalation in the community and
any such programme needs to have robust antimicrobial stewardship to support healthcare professionals in
avoiding inappropriate usage (www.antbiotcprescribing.ie) (HSE) and to prevent ‘protocol-driven’ inappropriate
emergency department, medical or surgical assessment unit referrals. It needs to be developed with the end
users and tested within its context to ensure that it fulfils its purpose without unintended consequences.


Awareness of sepsis and its symptoms and signs is an important part of public health education. Such a
programme should be embedded in a strategy to promote prevention of infection, antimicrobial stewardship
and the recognition of signs and symptoms of deterioration that should prompt urgent medical review.

**Infection and sepsis in the older population**

Infections in the elderly are different from infections in a younger population due to age-related alterations in
immunology and concomitant medical diseases – multimorbidity is the norm.


**28** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



They are more likely to:

 - have decreased gag and cough reflex – predisposing them to respiratory tract infections (RTIs).

 - be colonised by multi-resistant organisms.

 - have poor response to neoantigens and vaccines due to immunosenescence.

 - be less mobile than their younger counterparts and more prone to skin breakdown and decubiti.

 - have poor urinary bladder emptying, prostate enlargement and neurogenic bladder - predisposing them
to urinary tract infections (UTIs).

 - have a high risk of falls and injuries predisposing them to skin and wound infections.

 - Sepsis is more common and has a higher mortality when it occurs in patients with co-morbidities and as
we get older, we accumulate co-morbidities.


This population often presents with:

 - cognitive impairment – but there is a danger in normalising the abnormal.

 - diminished cardiopulmonary reflexes and physiological reserve,

 - malnutrition, endocrine deficiency, chronic inflammatory and prothrombotic effects of aging that
weaken the immune system.


A lower threshold and higher index of suspicion is required to recognise sepsis in this population.


**2.5 Guideline Scope**

**2.5.1 Target Population**

This NCG applies to adult patients with confirmed or suspected sepsis, including pregnant women in all clinical
settings in the acute sector.


The majority of recommendations and implementation points apply to both Adult non-pregnant patients and
women pregnant and in the postnatal period up to 42 days. Recognition in the maternity patient is slightly
different; therefore, maternity specific implementation points are signposted as such. All maternity specific
information is highlighted using purple text. Treatment and escalation are generally the same for both groups.
See maternity section for more details on the pregnant woman/post parturient.


**2.5.2 Purpose**

The purpose of this guideline is to implement the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline (SSCG) in the management
of the adult patient in the acute hospital sector in Ireland. It takes these international evidence-based
recommendations and implements them in a format that applies to the structures and functions of the Irish
Acute Health Care Sector. The National Sepsis Programme would like to thank the Surviving Sepsis Campaign for
permission to do this.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **29**


The recommendations in the guideline are structured as follows:


**i.** **SSCG - Key Questions**
**ii.** **SSCG - Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline Rationale**
**iii.** **SSCG - Recommendations**
**iv.** **NCG - Implementation Points (where relevant)**


All **SSCG references are numbered** are extracted directly from the SSCG document. Additional references that
have been incorporated into the implementation aspects are in a separate list called **National Clinical Guideline**
**References** and are listed **alphabetically** .


The recommendations of the SSCG are included so that it can be read as a standalone document. However,
it is recommended that clinicians familiarise themselves with the SSCG, and is endorsed by the Critical Care
Programme, the Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine in Ireland and the Intensive Care Society of Ireland.
An important guideline for those dealing with maternity is the ‘Critically ill women in obstetrics’ (HSE, 2014).


Implementation has been divided into three phases,
1. Recognition
2. Treatment
3. Escalation


Implementation points included after SSCG recommendations are aimed, primarily, at the pre and post-critical
care setting, recognizing that much of the research that informed the SSCG occurred in the critical care setting
and thus the SSCG can be more directly applied in that setting.


**The NCG is designed to guide clinical judgement but not replace it.** In individual cases a healthcare professional
may, after careful consideration, decide not to follow guideline recommendations if it is deemed to be in the
best interests of the patient and is in line with best practice. Clinical decisions and therapeutic options should
be discussed with a senior clinician on a case-by-case basis as necessary and documented in the clinical notes.


The Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and SepsisAssociated Organ Dysfunction in Children were published in February 2020. The HSE is adopting these guidelines
directly as a HSE protocol. The National Sepsis Programme will provide an implementation plan to enable the
application of the recommendations in the Irish health care setting.


The recommendations align with the aims of the National Sepsis Programme. Key recommendations are linked
with other recommendations, practical guidance, roles, responsibilities and processes. The recommendations
are linked to the best available evidence and/or expert opinion using the GRADE system for grading
recommendations.


**2.5.3 Target Users**

This guideline is relevant to all healthcare professionals involved in the care of adult and maternity patients with
sepsis and suspicion of sepsis, working in the acute hospital sector in the Republic of Ireland.


The guideline is also relevant to:

 - Department of Health (DoH) to support the development, implementation and audit of this National Clinical
Guideline.

 - The HSE to provide appropriate structured support and adequate resources for the governance,
operationalization, and audit of sepsis management.

 - The Hospital Group Leadership Team, Hospital Management and Clinical Directors to support sepsis quality
improvement and to foster and facilitate the implementation process and audit. They are also responsible
for effecting and monitoring change arising from outlier intervention.


**30** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**

 - Pre-Hospital Emergency Care to inform their clinical practice guidelines.

 - The public as an information resource.

Implementation Plan is available at: https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/c9fa9a-national-clinical-guidelines/


**2.6 Conflict of interest statement**

The guideline development process followed the conflict of interest policy set out by the NCEC. All members of
the Sepsis Management GDG were required to complete a conflict of interest declaration which was managed
by the National Sepsis Programme Manager. There were no conflicts of interest stated.


**2.7 Sources of funding**

There was no external funding, commercial input or resource provided for this guideline by any service or
organisation, and as such no potential for influence on editorial independence. The GDG sought and were
granted permission to adopt the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline for which no cost was incurred.


**2.8 Guideline methodology**

In order to update the 2014 Sepsis National Clinical Guideline (NCG) the National Sepsis Programme convened a
Guideline Development Group (GDG) consisting of key stakeholders, recognised experts in sepsis management
and patient advocates.


A literature search was undertaken by the HSE Library Service to identify any national and international sepsis
clinical guidelines published since the previous Sepsis NCG was published in 2014 which could be adopted or
adapted for use in the Irish Healthcare setting.


The search strategy included a search of Medline and PubMed using search terms related to the management
of sepsis and septic shock (Appendix 6). The websites of key organisations were also searched. The search
identified 11 documents, the majority of which were excluded immediately as they related to pre-hospital
care, non-acute care settings, paediatrics or were related to a specific type of sepsis, e.g. acute meningitis and
meningococcal sepsis.


When the exclusion criteria were applied only three guidelines were eligible for consideration:


 - NICE Sepsis: recognition, assessment and early management (NICE, 2017)

 - Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC): International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock
(Rhodes et al., 2017)

 - The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock (Nishida et al.,
2018)


The Prisma flow diagram illustrates the process undertaken in narrowing down the guidelines for appraisal.
(Figure 17. Appendix 6)


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **31**


In order to assess which guideline was relevant for the Irish Healthcare system and to appraise the quality of the
guidelines, including the rigour and transparency in which the guidelines were developed a quality assessment
was undertaken by two of the GDG Members using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II
(AGREE II) tool, (Brouwers et al., 2010). The SSC Guideline was the only guideline that scored >70% in all domains
and was ranked highest in all domains by both appraisers with overall domain percentages ranging 71-100%.
In addition, the appraisers noted that although the Japanese Guideline was an adaption of the SSC Guideline,
it was tailored for the Japanese healthcare system with some recommendations that were not widely available
within the Irish Healthcare system and the NICE Guideline although well researched and written, was tailored to
the UK health service and focused on many elements beyond the scope of the Irish NCG e.g. pre-hospital care
and paediatrics. Both appraisers agreed that based on the AGREE II process and the points noted previously that
the SSC Guideline should be adopted for use in the Irish Healthcare system.


The SSC Guideline which focuses on early management of sepsis and septic shock, underwent a robust
process to identify the evidence relating to five areas of practice (haemodynamics, infection, adjunctive
therapies, metabolic, and ventilation). An extensive search was performed for each PICO and the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system principles were used to guide the
assessment of the quality of evidence and to determine the strength of the recommendations. Both of these
are fully described in the SSC Guideline (Rhodes et al., 2017) and are summarised in Tables 10 and 11. Table
12 identifies the grading terminology used in the 2016 guideline. All of these terms are referred to within the
recommendations section of this document.


**Table 10.** Determination of the quality of evidence


**Underlying Methodology**
1. High: RCTs
2. Moderate: Downgraded RCTs or upgraded observational studies.
3. Low: Well-done observational studies with RCTs.
4. Very Low: Downgraded controlled studies or expert opinion or other evidence.


**Factors that may decrease the strength of evidence**
1. Methodologic features of available RCTs suggesting high likelihood of bias.
2. Inconsistency of results, including problems with subgroup analyses.
3. Indirectness of evidence (differing population, intervention, control, outcomes, comparison)
4. Imprecision of results.
5. High likelihood of reporting bias.


**Main factors that may increase the strength of evidence**
1. Large magnitude of effect (direct evidence, relative risk >2 with no plausible confounders)
2. Very large magnitude of effect with relative risk >5 and no threats to validity (by two level).
3. Dose-response gradient.

The guideline provides recommendations for good practice that are based on the best available clinical and cost
effectiveness evidence.


It was agreed by the GDG to fully adopt the SSC Guideline with the addition of implementation points to aid
the implementation of the guideline within the Irish Healthcare System in both pregnant and non-pregnant
adults. It was also agreed by the GDG to limit the NCG to adults, non-pregnant and pregnant, and to exclude
paediatrics from the scope of the guideline as the SSC Guideline refers to adults only. In addition, the Surviving
Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and Sepsis-Associated Organ
Dysfunction in Children were published in February 2020. The HSE is adopting these guidelines directly as a HSE
protocol. The National Sepsis Programme will provide an implementation plan to enable the application of the
recommendations in the Irish health care setting.

**2.9 Consultation summary**

The GDG sought to ensure that all stakeholders had an opportunity to review and contribute to the update
of the National Clinical Guideline for Sepsis. The guideline and feedback form were placed on the HSE public
website under the clinical programmes and the link was circulated to those listed in Appendix 7 with an invitation
to review and provide feedback. The GDG gratefully acknowledges the contribution made by all those who
contributed from professional, academic and patient groups.
The stakeholders are listed in Appendix 7.


**2.10 External review**

Two international experts were invited to review and provide feedback on an early draft of the guideline. These
experts were independent from the Guideline Development Group and selected based on their contribution to
academic literature and clinical practice:


1. Professor Kevin Rooney is a Consultant Anesthetist and Professor of Care Improvement at University of
the West of Scotland. He is the Clinical Lead for the Acute Adult Workstream of the Scottish Patient Safety
Program for Healthcare Improvement Scotland and led their breakthrough series collaborative on sepsis,
which resulted in a sustained relative risk reduction of 21% in sepsis mortality across Scotland.
2. Dr John Bates, Galway University Hospital, Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Dean of Joint
faculty of Intensive Care Medicine.


The GDG are very grateful to these reviewers for their time, expertise and contribution to this guideline.


**2.11 Implementation**

These guidelines are divided into sections with each one pertaining to a different aspect of patient
care. Recommendations from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline Update 2016 are labelled ‘SSCG
Recommendation’ and ‘SSCG Rationale’.


Implementation points are included to guide implementation of the SSCG recommendations in Ireland,
particularly in the non-critical care environment. The implementation points arise from piloting clinical decision
support tools in the acute hospital sector, particularly in emergency departments (EDs) and maternity units to
ensure that the implementation recommendations could be affected within the resources of our healthcare
system and had the support of end-users. The feedback from these pilots was overviewed by multidisciplinary
committees (the National Steering Committee and the Maternity Working Group) and the forms amended
based on this feedback and re-piloted, if required. Thus, the implementation programme is informed by endusers and by multidisciplinary specialist input.


Appendix 8 identifies the enablers and barriers to implementing the recommendations along with the
responsibilities and timelines.


Funding for guideline implementation is subject to service planning and the estimates process.


**2.12 Monitoring and audit**

The aim of this National Clinical Guideline is to reduce unnecessary variations in practice and provide an evidence
base for the most appropriate healthcare to optimize patient survival from sepsis.
The National Sepsis Programme (NSP) will monitor this aim in two ways:
(1) Audit of implementation of the NCG (Clinical audit/Process audit)
(2) Audit of outcomes resulting from implementation of the NCG (National Sepsis Report).


**34** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



**Clinical audit/Process audit** is the systematic review and evaluation of current practice against researchbased standards with a view to improving clinical care for service users and is an important part of any quality
improvement programme. It takes a snapshot of performance and benchmarks it against the guideline and thus
identifies areas that may benefit from improvement. Since process audit does not contextualize the decisions
made during a patient’s care episode, it is not designed to assess the quality of an individual care episode.
However, should an area of concern be identified it should be brought to the attention of the local hospital
sepsis committee for their consideration.

**Outcomes:** The primary aim of optimizing patient survival should be audited by the publication of age and
co-morbidity adjusted sepsis-associated (direct and in-direct) hospital mortality rates for each acute hospital
and benchmarked against the national average. International benchmarking of the national sepsis-associated
hospital mortality rate should be done against other high-income jurisdictions that publish such mortality rates.


The National Sepsis Report is published annually and describes the burden of sepsis, in terms of the number of
cases and the associated age adjusted mortality, to our healthcare system. The report (HSE 2019) recommends
the development of a sepsis mortality prediction model and scoring system to compare age and co-morbidity
adjusted hospital sepsis-associated mortality rates nationally and internationally.

Secondary outcome aims include healthcare utilization assessment such as the total number of bed days,
average length of stay, critical care admission rates and average length of stay, and hospital readmission rates
within three months (Chang et al., 2015) and should be reported where possible. The assessment of healthcare
utilization is important as a monitor of the effectiveness of the sepsis quality improvement programme and also
provides data for resource planning. As sepsis incidence increases with age with an ageing population it can
be expected that healthcare provision for sepsis care will increase. An effective programme can modulate this
increase.


**Maternity**
Sepsis outcome audits are carried out by The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD) in the UK
and Ireland. Since June 2012, these audits have been carried out by the MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies:
Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries) collaboration and Maternal Death Enquiry (MDE) in
the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre-Ireland. They are published on the National Perinatal Epidemiology
Unit (NPEU) website: https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports. Each topic-specific/sepsis confidential
enquiry chapter now appears in an annual report once every three years on a cyclical basis, in contrast to the
past when a single report was produced every three years.


**Practical guidance A:**
The GDG suggests that a tool be developed to risk adjust sepsis-associated hospital mortality (direct and indirect) based on the Hospital In-patient Enquiry database and that each acute hospital, on this database,
have annual risk-adjusted sepsis-associated mortality rates benchmarked against the national average. When
operational, this tool will facilitate the development of Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) for sepsis.


**Rationale:**
Optimising survival from sepsis depends on the hospital system working efficiently and effectively as a whole.
It requires effective communication, adequate resources and capacity both in infrastructure and staffing. Sepsis
management and risk-adjusted sepsis-associated hospital mortality are robust markers of the quality of acute
health care delivery.
Monitoring and acting on outcome audit ensures improvement occurs throughout the acute healthcare system
and is not sporadic. It informs the population a hospital serves and its staff on the effectiveness of its sepsis
management and supports improvement processes.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **35**


**Outlier management:**
Hospitals whose outcome measures are in excess of the control limits will, in the first instance have their data
reviewed by the national sepsis programme working group (Appendix 2). There are 3 possible outcomes from
this initial review:


1. No action warranted
2. Monitor pending further review
3. Outlier intervention warranted


**Outlier interventions:**
1. The National Sepsis Team, including the Hospital Group Sepsis ADON, will discuss the findings and the
outcome of the National Audit Committee data review with the Hospital Management and Clinical Director/s.
2. An improvement plan will be formulated by Hospital Management, the Clinical Director/s and the Sepsis/
Deteriorating Patient Committee, with advice from National Sepsis Team.
3. Audit of the improvement plan, its implementation and effect by the Hospital with support from the Hospital
Group Sepsis ADON and the Hospital Group Leadership Team to ensure any identified issues are addressed.
4. It is the responsibility of the Hospital Management, Clinical Director/s and Sepsis/ Deteriorating Patient
Committee to effect and monitor the findings of the outcome and process audits.


**Practical guidance B**
The GDG suggest that intermittent process audit be performed to support improvements in sepsis recognition,
management and escalation.


**Rationale:**
The purpose of these audits is to benchmark different areas of practice against these guidelines for the purpose
of informing on-going education and performance improvement initiatives.


The National Sepsis Programme will agree the process audit schedule annually and inform Hospital Group
leadership of same. The Group Sepsis ADONs will also notify local sepsis committees and plan accordingly.


The process audits will be carried by the Group ADONs in collaboration with appropriate staff in local hospitals.


Process audit does not review the context of decision-making in patient management and as such, cannot
comment on the standard of care relating to an individual patient. However, if during the course of an audit,
the possibility of a serious patient safety incident is considered this should be brought to the attention of the
Sepsis/ Deteriorating Patient Committee. It is the responsibility of the Committee to decide if any further action
is warranted.


It is the responsibility of the hospital sepsis committee to inform clinicians of the audit findings and to adjust the
hospital’s sepsis education programme to improve management and to effect, along with hospital management,
any outlier interventions.


**36** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



**Practical guidance C**
The GDG suggests that an annual sepsis outcome report be published which includes, but is not limited to:

 - the risk-adjusted hospital mortality rates

 - the incidence, patient characteristics and healthcare utilization of patients with sepsis during their
hospitalization

 - hospital group level amalgamated process audit results

 - balancing measures.


**Rationale:**
A culture of openness promotes good practice and confidence in the healthcare system. It is important that
the community is aware of the limitations of sepsis care, its high mortality risk and the efforts being made
to reduce that risk. Sepsis guidelines are based on the best available information at the time of publication;
however, they are just guidelines and cannot anticipate the complexity of an individual case. Data collection on
patient characteristics and risk factors allows the identification of high-risk patients for prioritization. However,
for every patient prioritized there are others who have been deemed less at risk. When capacity is challenging,
getting this right is a vital and difficult component of time-dependent care especially when the clinical scenario
is evolving. A hospital working within the control limits of the national average demonstrates that it is providing
a service, in terms of sepsis care, that is as good as anywhere else within the state.


**Balancing measures:**
Audits should also include considerations of potential unintended consequences of the National Sepsis
Programme including inappropriate antimicrobial use. Inappropriate antimicrobial use is a patient safety issue
(e.g. adverse reactions, Clostridium difficile infection) and of public health concern (increased rates of multidrug
resistant organisms, MDRO) (DOH, 2017a).
In relation to antimicrobial use, there are at least three potential unintended consequences of implementing
the Sepsis 6 bundle:


1. Patients who have deteriorated but have no evidence of potential infective source/sepsis are commenced
inappropriately on antimicrobial therapy.
2. Patients with sepsis are commenced on inappropriate antimicrobial therapy that is not in line with local
guidelines.
3. Empiric antimicrobial therapy that has been commenced in a patient with suspected sepsis is not reviewed
at 24-48 hours as recommended by the Start Smart, then Focus Antimicrobial Care bundle (RCPI, 2012).


All hospitals should have antimicrobial stewardship programmes in place as outlined in National Guidelines
(DOH, 2017a) (HSE, 2019a) that monitor process and outcome measures to ensure that antimicrobials are not
being prescribed unnecessarily due to inappropriate application of Sepsis 6/Sepsis 6 + 1. Ensuring antimicrobials
are used appropriately for all infections, not just those associated with sepsis, will help to ensure effective
antimicrobial therapy is available when cases of sepsis do occur.


**Roles and responsibilities:**
The National Sepsis Programme is responsible for publishing an annual sepsis outcome report. Working with the
Health Pricing Office (HPO), the National Sepsis Programme will provide guidance on what outcomes, processes
and patient characteristics to audit and will review audit methodology and results to ensure that they make
clinical and statistical sense. It is the responsibility of the Programme to provide outlier support to hospitals
when indicated.
It is the responsibility of sepsis committees, Hospital Management and Hospital Group Leadership to effect
recommendations arising out of outlier intervention.

It is the responsibility of the Department of Health, the HSE, hospital group leadership and hospital management
to support the audit process and to ensure that adequate resources are available to perform the audit and to
effect change required based on audit results.


It is the responsibility of the Department of Health and the HSE to resource a risk-adjusted sepsis-associated
hospital mortality rate audit tool as the key performance indicator for sepsis in Ireland.


**2.13 Legislation and other related policies**

On occasion in clinical practice, prescriptions are written for licensed drugs given for unlicensed indications,
and/or via an unlicensed route (NCEC, 2015b). Often it is simply a matter of the route or dose being different
from those in the manufacturer’s SPC (summary of product characteristics). It is of note that the licensing
process for drugs regulates the marketing activities of pharmaceutical companies, and not prescribing practice.
Unlicensed use of drugs by prescribers is often appropriate and guided by clinical judgment. This practice is
safeguarded in legislation in accordance with Medicinal Products (Control of Placing on the Market) Regulations
2007 (S.I 540/2007) as amended, (GOV, 2007). Furthermore, drugs prescribed outside license can be dispensed
by pharmacists and administered by nurses or midwives (NCEC, 2015b).


**2.14 Plan to update this National Clinical Guideline**

This guideline will be scheduled for review 3 years after publication by the National Sepsis Programme. In the
event that new relevant evidence comes to light, then a rapid update may be required within the three-year
period.

| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



**COVID-19**
Any infection, including viral infections like the flu and COVID-19 can cause sepsis. Similarly to sepsis, anybody
can develop COVID-19 if they become infected with SARS-CoV-2, but some people are at higher risk such as those
with a weak immune system (Global Sepsis Alliance, 2020). The effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system
can result in patients requiring hospital admission with varying degrees of pneumonia, however other organs
can be affected with signs of multi organ failure typical of sepsis occurring in around 2-5% after approximate
8-10 days of infection and sadly many patients affected by COVID-19 will die from sepsis and its complications
(Global Sepsis Alliance, 2020), (Yang et al., 2020).


Known risk factors for rapid deterioration, severe disease, and/or increased mortality are: older age  (> 60
years) and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer and
cerebrovascular disease (Huang et al., 2020) and also obesity (Centre for Disease Control, 2020). Patients with
one or more of these risk factors should be monitored closely for deterioration.


**Maternity**
Most pregnant women who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 will experience only mild or moderate cold/flu-like
symptoms, (RCOG, 2020). However, health care providers should consider all differential diagnoses for women
who present with a fever in pregnancy and postnatal up to 42 days and follow national advice and guidance.
Although the evidence is limited, pregnant women who are older, overweight and have pre-existing medical
conditions such as hypertension or diabetes may have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 including
being admitted to intensive care (WHO, 2020) (Allotey et al., 2020).


It also recommend that women from a Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic (BAME) group should also seek advice
without delay if they are concerned about symptoms of COVID-19, (MMBRACE, 2020).


Pregnant women should be counselled about the risk for severe COVID-19 associated illness and measures to
prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be emphasised for pregnant women and their families (Zambrano,
2020),(WHO, 2020).


The treatment and management of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly. The HSE monitors the evidence provided both
nationally and internationally and has provided a repository of interim guidance for healthcare professionals
on the treatment and management of COVID-19. This repository is updated regularly when new evidence is
published and the link can be found here:
htps://hse.drsteevenslibrary.ie/Covid19V2


For all other cases of sepsis and septic shock not related to COVID-19, the following recommendations should
be adhered to.


**National Clinical Guideline Recommendations**

Recommendations from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guideline Update 2016 and 2018 are adopted
in total for this guideline. Recommendations are labelled 1-93 and are divided into sections with each one
pertaining to a different aspect of patient care. Additionally, National Implementation Points are provided
and are for the purpose of implementing the SSCG, in the Irish context, particularly in the non-critical care
environment.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **39**


The implementation points arise from piloting clinical decision support tools in the acute hospital sector,
in particular emergency departments (EDs) and maternity units to ensure that the implementation
recommendations could be affected within the resources of our healthcare system and had the support of
end-users. The feedback from these pilots was overseen by multidisciplinary committees (the National
Steering Committee and the Maternal Sepsis Form oversight committee) and the forms amended based on this
feedback and re-piloted, if required. Thus, the implementation programme is informed by end-users and by
multidisciplinary specialist input.


**The following guidance is based on the best available evidence. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline**

**3.1 Key questions, evidence statements and recommendations**

**3.1.1 Recognition, Screening for Sepsis and Performance Improvement**

**Key question**

 - Should hospitals use a formal resourced performance improvement program for sepsis including sepsis
screening for acutely ill, high risk patients?


**SSCG Rationale**
Performance improvement efforts for sepsis are associated with improved patient outcomes (40). Sepsis
performance improvement programs should optimally have multi-professional representation (physicians,
nurses, affiliate providers, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, dieticians, administrators) with stakeholders
from all key disciplines represented in their development and implementation. Successful programs should
include protocol development and implementation, targeted metrics to be evaluated, data collection, and ongoing feedback to facilitate continuous performance improvement (41). In addition to traditional continuing
education efforts to introduce guidelines into clinical practice, knowledge translation efforts can be valuable in
promoting the use of high-quality evidence in changing behaviour (42).

Sepsis performance improvement programs can be aimed at earlier recognition of sepsis via a formal
screening effort and improved management of patients once they are identified as being septic. Because lack
of recognition prevents timely therapy, sepsis screening is associated with earlier treatment (43,44).  Notably,
sepsis screening has been associated with decreased mortality in several studies (20,45). The implementation
of a core set of recommendations (“bundle”) has been a cornerstone of sepsis performance improvement
programs aimed at improving management (46). Note that the SSC bundles have been developed separately
from the guidelines in conjunction with an educational and improvement partnership with the Institute for
Healthcare Improvement (46). The SSC bundles that are based on previous guidelines have been adopted by
the U.S.-based National Quality Forum and have also been adapted by the U.S. healthcare system’s regulatory
agencies for public reporting. To align with emerging evidence and U.S. national efforts, the SSC bundles were
revised in 2015.


While specifics vary widely among different programs, a common theme is the drive toward improvement in
compliance with sepsis bundles and practice guidelines such as SSC (8). A meta-analysis of 50 observational
studies demonstrated that performance improvement programs were associated with a significant increase in


**40** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



compliance with the SSC bundles and a reduction in mortality (OR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61–0.72)(47). The largest study
to date examined the relationship between compliance with the SSC bundles (based on the 2004 guidelines)
and mortality. A total of 29,470 patients in 218 hospitals in the United States, Europe, and South America were
examined over a 7.5-year period. Lower mortality was observed in hospitals with higher compliance. Overall
hospital mortality decreased 0.7% for every 3 months a hospital participated in the SSC, associated with a
4% decreased LOS for every 10% improvement in compliance with bundles. This benefit has also been shown
across a wide geographic spectrum. A study of 1,794 patients from 62 countries with severe sepsis (now termed
“sepsis” after the Sepsis-3 definition (1) or septic shock demonstrated a 36%–40% reduction of the odds of dying
in the hospital with compliance with either the 3- or 6-hour SSC bundles (48). This recommendation met the
pre-specified criteria for a BPS. The specifics of performance improvement methods varied markedly between
studies; thus, no single approach to performance improvement could be recommended (Supplemental Digital
Content 5, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C326).


**Recommendation 1.** (SSCG Section B, Recommendation 1).
We recommend that hospitals and hospital systems have a performance improvement program for sepsis,
including sepsis screening for acutely ill, high-risk patients.
**Quality/level of evidence: Low        + Strength of recommendation: BPS**


**Implementation Point 1 (Recommendation 1)**
The National Sepsis Programme will support and monitor sepsis performance improvement to promote the
population receiving safe and high-quality sepsis care.
The National Sepsis Programme follows the governance structure outlined in Figure 3 to coordinate the
implementation and audit of the guideline.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **41**


**Figure 3.** The National Sepsis Programme Governance Structure

The **National Sepsis Steering Committee** is a multi-disciplinary committee recognizing that sepsis affects all
specialties and services. Its membership and terms of reference are listed in Appendix 1 & 2.

The National Sepsis Team reports to the steering committee and the office of the National Clinical Advisor and
Group Lead for Acute Hospitals, Health Services Executive (HSE) and works with the National Clinical Effectiveness
Committee for the scheduled updates of the National Clinical Guideline and advises the Department of Health on
issues related to sepsis. Its membership and terms of reference are listed in Appendix 1 & 2.

**Hospital Sepsis Committee:** All acute hospitals are required to have a Sepsis Committee whose role is to guide
the implementation of the National Clinical Guideline in their hospital by coordinating education, sepsis form
rollout and reviewing audit feedback and using it to inform the education and roll-out processes. A stand-alone
sepsis committee may be desirable and should be supported, it may also be appropriate for individual hospitals
to incorporate this committee under an umbrella group, such as a deteriorating patient committee, provided
some important caveats are adhered to:

1. The Terms of Reference (TOR) of the umbrella committee should state that sepsis is a standing item on
the agenda and ample time should be set aside for discussion of relevant issues such as national updates,
mandatory education status across all disciplines, sepsis audit recommendations and status of resulting action
plans, and plans for World Sepsis Day awareness campaigns.

2. The TOR should state that the Sepsis ADON for the relevant Health Region should be a committee member

3. The arrangement should be reviewed every 12 months with the Sepsis ADON for each Health Region reporting
back to the National Sepsis Team **[new 2025]** . This committee, along with Hospital Management and the
Clinical Directors, has responsibility for effecting and auditing the improvements identified due to audit outlier
intervention. This committee is multi-disciplinary with a named medical and nursing/midwifery lead with the
inclusion of NCHDs, clinical microbiology, pharmacy (e.g. antimicrobial pharmacist), coding, practice facilitators
and educators and may invite other specialties as required.


**42** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



The committees liaise with their Group Sepsis Assistant Director of Nursing/Midwifery (ADON/M) and
the National Team, this is a two-way relationship with the sepsis committees feeding back to the programme
on the usefulness of aids and algorithms, suggestions to improve sepsis management and suggesting specific
audits. Ideally, there should be a Hospital Group Sepsis ADON/M as a member of each hospital committee in
their group.


In turn the National Team provides tools to assist education, implementation and audit feedback. Should outlier
intervention be required, the National Team can advise the Hospital Sepsis Committee and Management and
offer further education and audit support. The Hospital Group Sepsis ADON/M works with the hospital, the
Hospital Group Leadership Team and the National Sepsis Team to support sepsis quality improvement.


**Sepsis Education:** This guideline recognises that the responsibility for sepsis education falls under a number of
domains and recommends that education providers ensure that their education curricula are consistent with
the National Clinical Guideline and its implementation programme.



**Figure 4.** Sepsis Education Overview


**Roles and Responsibilities**





It is the responsibility of the Department of Health (DoH) to support the development, implementation and
audit of this National Clinical Guideline.

It is the responsibility of the HSE to provide appropriate structured support and adequate resources for the
governance, operationalization, and audit of sepsis management.
It is the responsibility of the Sepsis Steering Committee to provide clinical expertise and guidance for the
National Sepsis Programme.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **43**


It is the responsibility of the National Sepsis Team to ensure that clinical guidance is in line with best
international practice, to provide clinical advice and decision support tools to local hospital sepsis committees
and to oversee process and outcome audit, provide feedback and to advice on outlier intervention when
required.


It is the responsibility of the Hospital Group Leadership Team, Hospital Management and Clinical Directors to
support sepsis quality improvement and to foster and facilitate the implementation process and audit. They
are also responsible for effecting and monitoring change arising from outlier intervention.
It is the responsibility of hospital sepsis committees to co-ordinate sepsis guideline implementation in their
hospital and to work with the Hospital Group Sepsis Assistant Directors of Nursing/Midwifery (ADON/Ms)
and the National Sepsis Team with the aim of optimizing sepsis recognition and treatment. They are also
responsible for ensuring that staff are aware of the sepsis eLearning module on HSeLanD and that sepsis is
included in induction for all relevant healthcare professionals.


It is the responsibility of the Sepsis ADON/Ms to help support the local hospital sepsis committees’ aims by
performing audit and feedback on the sepsis care in their institution and by liaising with the National Sepsis
Programme to ensure effective communication between the Programme, the Hospital Group Leadership
and Local Hospitals. The Sepsis ADONs also have a role in fostering new sepsis initiatives and international
benchmarking.


It is the responsibility of Nursing/Midwifery and Medical Colleges, Under and Post-Graduate to ensure that
their sepsis curricula are consistent with the National Clinical Guideline and provide their graduates with the
appropriate knowledge and skillset to be able to comply with the recommendations therein.
Healthcare professionals are responsible for undertaking relevant education as often as they deem necessary
to develop their professional practice and maintain their professional competence.


**Implementation Point 2 (Recommendation 1)**
**Adopt strategies for the prevention of infection and sepsis.**

**Hand hygiene:**
Healthcare associated infections, which are infections acquired during health care delivery, are common and
are a risk factor for developing sepsis. Effective hand hygiene plays a key role in preventing infection. The 5
moments of hand hygiene should be incorporated into practice and patients and visitors/carers should be
instructed on how to perform hand hygiene to protect themselves too.


**Food hygiene:**
Pregnant women should avoid ‘deli’ meats; prepared dairy-based dressings, raw milk, soft cheeses, pâtés
and smoked fish. All these are associated with listeriosis. Pregnant women should be advised to cook food
thoroughly, especially meat, ensuring that it is cooked through to the middle. Salads, fruit and raw vegetables
should be washed thoroughly before eating to prevent Listeriosis and Toxoplasmosis (Aylin et al., 2007).

**Vaccination or immunization:**
Sepsis cannot always be prevented but promoting the uptake of vaccinations to reduce the risk of infection
may also reduce the risk of developing sepsis. Compliance with primary childhood immunisations including
measles, mumps and rubella is very important particularly for women planning to conceive. Pneumococcal
vaccine and annual flu vaccine should be promoted where appropriate.


**44** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**


**Maternity only**


**Vaccination**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Modulation of the immune system occurs in pregnancy. Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe
illness from influenza virus. The MBRRACE-UK confidential enquiry into maternal mortality during the
H1N1 epidemic (2009-2012) demonstrated that one in eleven maternal mortalities were directly from the
influenza virus (Knight M, 2014). Kay et al., found that vigorous cellular immune responses to influenza during
pregnancy could drive pulmonary inflammation, explaining the increased morbidity and mortality (Kay et al.,
2014).

Seasonal influenza and pertussis vaccination should be offered in any antenatal clinical setting. See
https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/flu-vaccination/flu-vaccine-pregnancy/ for up to
date recommendations. MMR childhood vaccination should be confirmed and if not recorded the advice
outlined in https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/pregvaccs/ should be followed. Rubella
(German measles) is particularly harmful to a fetus in early pregnancy as it can cause major birth defects.


**Breastfeeding**

Neonates have a developing immune system (Basha et al., 2014), and haven’t been exposed to
microorganisms in the environment. Breastfeeding protects against neonatal infections and sepsis (Xpress,
2019). Mother’s milk includes large amounts of secretory IgA antibodies produced by lymphocytes which
have migrated from the mother’s gut to the mammary glands (Delves, 2000) (Delves PJ, 2000). The newborn
is colonized with microbes from the mother’s intestinal flora both during and after birth thus, breastfeeding
controls the early exposure of the neonate’s intestinal mucosa to microbes and limits bacterial translocation
through the gut mucosa. Immunoglobulins which give protection for the first three months of life are
transferred across the placenta before birth (Basha et al., 2014, Delves, 2000).


**Animal Borne infections**

Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by a parasite that infects warm-blooded animals, primarily cats. Women
who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should avoid contact with all rodents and their droppings, including
avoiding changing cat litter. If no one else can perform the task, disposable gloves should be worn, and hands
washed with soap and warm water afterwards. Adopting or handling stray cats, especially kittens, should be
avoided.

The HSE has further information on toxoplasmosis at www.hpsc.ie.


**Implementation Point 3 (Recommendation 1)**
Patients presenting or deteriorating as an inpatient, where infection is suspected to be the cause, are screened
to identify those who are at high risk of mortality from sepsis.


Sepsis occurs most frequently at the extremes of age as illustrated in Figure 5. It is more common and has a
higher mortality when it occurs in patients with co-morbidities (Figure 6), and as we get older, we accumulate
co-morbidities. Certain medications act by suppressing the immune system and patients taking them are more
susceptible to infection and sepsis. In Ireland there is no gender difference in mortality although sepsis is more
common in males (Figure 7). This is also consistent with the published literature (HSE, 2019b, Navaneelan T,
2016, Martin et al., 2003, Angus et al., 2001, Brun-Buisson et al., 1995).

_* ‘Sepsis-associated’ includes direct and indirect deaths. Causality cannot be inferred from administrative databases._

**Figure 5.** In-patient sepsis-associated hospital mortality* by age groups, 2018, (HSE, 2019b)


Profiling at-risk patient groups facilitates early recognition and treatment, which is the only proven method of
reducing mortality from sepsis.







**Figure 6.** Inpatient sepsis-associated hospital mortality according to number of co-morbidities, 2018 (HSE, 2019b)


**46** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2









**Figure 7.** Inpatient sepsis-associated hospital mortality by gender, 2018 (HSE, 2019)


**Maternity only**
Sepsis, including deaths from all infectious causes, remains a leading contributor to maternal morbidity and
mortality in both high- and low-income countries (MBRRACE, 2014). Sepsis was the leading cause of direct
maternal mortalities in the Centre for Maternal & Child Enquiries (CMACE, 2011) and the second leading cause
of maternal mortalities in the Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audit and Confidential Enquiry
(MBRRACE). The latest MBRRACE (2019) publication shows sepsis as the 4th leading direct cause with an
increase in direct causes due to sepsis and an increase in indirect sepsis deaths from the previous report.
Irish data demonstrates an increase in reported diagnoses of both sepsis and infection. In 2018, there were
61,016 live births in Ireland, and 9,471 maternity patients (period from conception up to 42 days post-birth or
miscarriage) were either admitted to hospital with an infection or diagnosed with an infection as an in-patient.
442 were diagnosed with sepsis. However, it must be noted these cases were diagnosed using the Sepsis-2
definition of sepsis i.e. SIRS of infectious origin and thus include a wide range of acuity (HSE, 2019b).
Identifying pregnant women with sepsis can be particularly challenging as clinical and laboratory criteria
may overlay with normal pregnant physiology (Parfitt, 2018) (Abir et al., 2017). The physiological changes of
pregnancy, including an increase in heart rate (tachycardia), respiratory rate (tachypnoea) and cardiac output,
combined with a rise in white cell count that peaks after delivery, can mask sepsis indicators normally seen
in the non-pregnant population. If these observations are persistently abnormal it is important to rule out a
pathological reason. Additionally, the altered physiology of pregnancy and the postnatal period can result in
women presenting with vague signs and symptoms of sepsis. It may be difficult to distinguish between normal
and pathological states. Importantly, pregnant and recently delivered women have a significant capacity to
compensate physiologically to major stresses to the body (such as haemorrhage or sepsis), and therefore
signs of tachycardia or hypotension (reduced blood pressure) may not appear until late, when sudden clinical
deterioration becomes apparent. Sepsis, therefore, requires a high index of suspicion, as it may be difficult to
diagnose resulting in delayed initiation of appropriate treatment and significant morbidity or mortality.


**Screening**
The purpose of screening is to identify patients with a high-risk presentation e.g. clinically apparent acute organ
dysfunction such as acute confusion, respiratory failure or a purpuric rash AND patients who because of their
medical history, e.g. on chemotherapy or having chronic co-morbidities or additional factors such as frailty, age
≥75 and recent trauma or surgery, have a high mortality risk if they have sepsis.


Sepsis diagnosis is not always obvious as the presentation can be variable. Having clinical decision support
tools can help clinicians to identify high-risk patients, in making the diagnosis of sepsis and in the initiation of
treatment.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **47**


Emergency Medicine Early Warning System (EMEWS) is recommended for use in EDs when patients are waiting
longer for review by a Treating Clinician than is recommended based on their Manchester Triage System (MTS)
Category. National Clinical Guideline No. 18: Emergency Medicine Early Warning System (EMEWS) strongly
recommends adherence to the NCEC National Clinical Guideline No. 6 Sepsis Management in patients with a
clinical suspicion of infection/sepsis (NCEC, 2018).


The Irish National Early Warning System (2020) (INEWS), is recommended as the system to be used to identify
high risk and deteriorating admitted patients with infection and sepsis. An INEWS of ≥ 4 or 5 if on supplementary
oxygen should prompt sepsis screening if infection is suspected.
The guideline is available to download from the National Clinical Effectiveness committee website at:
https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/c9fa9a-national-clinical-guidelines/?referrer=/national-patient-safety-office/
ncec/national-clinical-guidelines


The NEWS (NCEC, 2013) deployed in Ireland for the identification of deterioration of in-patients and in head to
head testing has been shown to outperform qSOFA (Goulden et al., 2018) (Churpek et al., 2017).
Three patient groups have been identified as having a mortality risk of > 20% from sepsis (HSE, 2019b). All three
patient presentations should be assigned Category 2 at Triage (unless Category 1 criteria apply) or have medical
review within 30 minutes if an inpatient, if they present unwell or deteriorate and have signs and symptoms
consistent with infection.


**Patients at high risk of mortality from sepsis:**
1. Patients at risk of neutropenia, due to bone marrow failure, autoimmune disorder or treatment including
but not limited to, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, who present unwell, that is with specific or nonspecific symptoms and signs of infection.

2. Patients presenting with clinical criteria for one or more acute organ dysfunction and a suspicion of
infection as the cause.

**i. Acutely altered mental state**
New onset confusion/agitation
Altered functional state in an individual with underlying neurological disorder/ disability
Decreased Glasgow Coma Scale Score
**ii. Respiratory dysfunction**
Sustained respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute
Laboured breathing
Hypoxia/ cyanosis
Respiratory failure requiring invasive or non-invasive support
**iii. Cardiovascular dysfunction**
Tachycardia > 130 beats per minute
Systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg or > 40mmHg drop from usual pressure
Pale cold peripheries with prolonged central capillary refill
Inability to stand due to sustained dizziness with signs of hypoperfusion
**iv. Renal dysfunction**
Oligo or anuria for > 12 hours with no urgency
**v. Coagulation dysfunction**
Non-blanching, mottled or petechial rash
**vi. Liver dysfunction**
Jaundice


**48** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



3. Patients who present with a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) to infection and who have 1 or more
co-morbidity or additional factor associated with higher risk of mortality in sepsis.

**Co-morbidities:**
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Diabetes mellitus
Cancer
Chronic kidney disease
Chronic liver disease
Immunosuppression

**Additional factors:**
Frailty
Age ≥ 75 years
Recent major surgery or trauma


Clinical Decision Support Tools (CDST’s) such as the ‘Think Sepsis at Triage’ algorithm (Figure 8) or the Screening
Algorithm for In-Patients (Figure 9) will help nurses to:
a) Correctly risk stratify ‘at-risk’ patients
b) Escalate to medical review in a timely manner
c) Start the appropriate sepsis form (Appendix 9). The completed sepsis form should be placed with the
patient’s documentation to assist in their management and diagnosis of sepsis. Clinicians should consider
documenting when patients with infection screen negative for these high-risk categories. This guidance
aims to support clinical decision-making and not to replace it, always exercising clinical judgment.


The outcome from screening is NOT the initiation of the Sepsis 6 bundle but rather to prompt an early thorough
medical review. The result of the screen is communicated to the treating clinician so that sepsis is considered
during the medical review. The ISBAR communication tool can be used to structure this communication. National
clinical guidelines No 5 and 11 provide guidance on communication in both maternity and acute hospital service
for adult and children, NCEC 2014, NCEC 2015). Links to these and other supporting tools, documents and
websites can be found in Appendix 10)


If infection is included in the differential diagnosis, and the patient is in one of the at-risk groups then the Sepsis 6
bundle is administered. For this reason, 1 hour is allowed for screening and medical review and once completed
this is considered TIME ZERO. All elements of the Sepsis 6 bundle are to be initiated within 1 hour of TIME ZERO.


**TIME ZERO** is the time at which a healthcare professional first recognises that a patient with suspected or
confirmed infection has POSSIBLE SEPSIS, PROBABLE SEPSIS or SEPTIC SHOCK.
**For patients with probable sepsis +/- shock,**
Sepsis 6 bundle should be initiated immediately and completed within 1 hour of Time Zero
**For patients with possible sepsis without shock,**
A time-limited course of rapid investigations should be undertaken and if concern for infection persists when
clinical and laboratory data is reviewed, the administration of antimicrobials should be completed within 3 hours
of Time Zero. **[new 2025]**


For patients who present with clinically apparent sepsis/septic shock, it is recommended that the Sepsis 6
bundle be administered within 1 hour of presentation (Levy et al., 2018).


In summary, patients who present to Emergency Department (ED) Triage with suspected infection or who
deteriorate on the ward due to suspected infection should be screened to see if they fit into one of the highrisk groups. Deterioration on the ward is suggested by a INEWS score that has risen to ≥ 4 (≥ 5 if already on
supplementary oxygen therapy) (NCEC, 2013) or by exercising clinical judgment. The patient should be escalated
to medical review as per the ‘Think Sepsis at Triage’ algorithm or the INEWS escalation and response protocol
and an appropriate sepsis form (Appendix 9) completed and placed with the patient’s case notes.

Note: Sepsis may also need to be considered in patients whose INEWS score is < 4. However, it is recommended
that patients with a INEWS ≥ 4 have a medical review within 30 minutes (NCEC, 2013) and if infection is suspected
as the cause sepsis needs to be considered.


Patients who are attending other departments in the hospital such as outpatients and who become a cause
of concern due to infection may be screened according to the Triage or INEWS criteria as best suits the clinical
circumstance.


**Screening**
**Maternity only**
Sepsis is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality in obstetrics. Alongside thromboembolism (direct)
and heart disease (indirect), sepsis is one of the leading causes of both direct and indirect morbidity (Knight
M, 2019). Physiological changes of pregnancy may create a vulnerable environment, predisposing women
to develop sepsis. These changes can mask, or mimic sepsis indicators seen in the non-obstetric population,
making it difficult to recognise sepsis and possibly delaying treatment. The Irish Maternity Early Warning System
(IMEWS) is recommended for the monitoring and detection of physiological deterioration in pregnant and
postpartum women (NCEC, 2019).


The use of maternal-specific clinical decision support tools for sepsis identification and knowledge of appropriate
interventions and their effects on the woman and fetus can help clinicians obtain the best outcomes in acute
care settings (Parfitt, 2018).


The maternity sepsis form provides a time dependent pathway which aids the midwife in recognising women
at risk of sepsis and supports effective communication to the medical professional. The form also supports the
doctor in identifying women who should get the Sepsis 6+1 bundle and guides its completion. The form also lists
the diagnostic criteria for sepsis and septic shock and the appropriate escalation for both. It can be found on the
Maternal & Newborn Clinical Management System (MN-CMS) via the ‘AD HOC’ tab.

**Up to 42 days Post birth**
Many women are seen in the community by the Community Midwife, Community Midwifery Services from
acute settings or a Public Health Nurse. A screening tool has been developed to aid early recognition of potential
sepsis and advice on pathway of care (Appendix 11).


**Pre-hospital**
Pre-hospital emergency care is the clinical process of assessment, treatment and disposition of patients following
an acute event in the community. As sepsis is a syndrome and not a specific disease, Pre-Hospital Emergency
Care Council (PHECC) registered practitioners (EMT, paramedic and advanced paramedic) are advised to have
a high index of suspicion in relation to sepsis for unwell patients. PHECC practitioners utilise Clinical Practice
Guidelines (CPGs) to inform their scope of practice (Appendix 12).

**Roles and responsibilities:**
It is the responsibility of the HSE, Hospital Group and Hospital Management to facilitate appropriate training and
provide adequate resources for the screening of patients with infection for high risk of mortality from sepsis.


It is the responsibility of clinicians to be familiar with the three high-risk presentations and to escalate care
according to the Triage and Inpatient algorithms.
It is the responsibility of all clinicians working in the acute hospital sector to be familiar with the INEWS and any
other relevant early warning systems.


**3.1.2 Initial Treatment**

**Key questions**

 - In patients with sepsis or septic shock, should we use crystalloid with supplemental albumin for initial
resuscitation versus crystalloids alone?

 - In patients with sepsis or septic shock, should we be using HES versus crystalloids for acute resuscitation?

 - In patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, should we be using gelatin versus crystalloid for acute
resuscitation?

 - In patients with sepsis or septic shock, should we use using balanced crystalloid solutions versus normal
saline?

 - In patients with sepsis or septic shock, should we recommend using repeated fluid challenge based on
hemodynamic variables?

 - In patients with sepsis or septic shock, should we use early goal directed therapy protocol for resuscitation?

 - In patients with sepsis or septic shock with elevated serum lactate, should we incorporate resuscitation
goals aiming to normalize lactate levels?

 - In patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors, should we target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65
mmHg vs. higher MAP?

 - In patients with sepsis or septic shock, should we use dynamic parameters (versus static parameters) to
predict fluid responsiveness?

**SSCG Rationale**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Early effective fluid resuscitation is crucial for stabilization of sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion or septic
shock. Sepsis-induced hypoperfusion may be manifested by acute organ dysfunction and/or ± decreased blood
pressure and increased serum lactate. Previous iterations of these guidelines have recommended a protocolized
quantitative resuscitation, otherwise known as early goal-directed therapy (EGDT), which was based on the
protocol published by Rivers (16). This recommendation described the use of a series of “goals” that included
central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). This approach has now been
challenged following the failure to show a mortality reduction in three subsequent large multi-centre RCTs
(17–19). No harm was associated with the interventional strategies; thus, the use of the previous targets is still
safe and may be considered. Of note, the more recent trials included less severely ill patients (lower baseline
lactate levels, Scvo2 at or above the target value on admission, and lower mortality in the control group). Although
this protocol cannot now be recommended from its evidence base, bedside clinicians still need guidance as
to how to approach this group of patients who have significant mortality and morbidity. We recommend,
therefore, that these patients be viewed as having a medical emergency that necessitates urgent assessment
and treatment. As part of this, we recommend that initial fluid resuscitation begin with 30 mL/kg of crystalloid
within the first 3 hours. This fixed volume of fluid enables clinicians to initiate resuscitation while obtaining
more specific information about the patient and while awaiting more precise measurements of hemodynamic
status. Although little literature includes controlled data to support this volume of fluid, recent interventional
studies have described this as usual practice in the early stages of resuscitation, and observational evidence
supports the practice (20, 21). The average volume of fluid pre-randomization given in the PROCESS and ARISE
trials was approximately 30mL/kg, and approximately 2 litres in the PROMISE trial (17–19). Many patients will
require more fluid than this, and for this group we advocate that further fluid be given in accordance with
functional hemodynamic measurements.


One of the most important principles to understand in the management of these complex patients is the need
for a detailed initial assessment and ongoing re-evaluation of the response to treatment. This evaluation should
start with a thorough clinical examination and evaluation of available physiologic variables that can describe
the patient’s clinical state (heart rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, temperature,
urine output, and others as available).  Echocardiography in recent years has become available to many bedside
clinicians and enables a more detailed assessment of the causes of the hemodynamic issues (22).


The use of CVP alone to guide fluid resuscitation can no longer be justified (22) because the ability to predict
a response to a fluid challenge when the CVP is within a relatively normal range (8–12 mm Hg) is limited
(23). The same holds true for other static measurements of right or left heart pressures or volumes. Dynamic
measures of assessing whether a patient requires additional fluid have been proposed in an effort to improve
fluid management and have demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy at predicting those patients who are
likely to respond to a fluid challenge by increasing stroke volume. These techniques encompass passive leg
raises, fluid challenges against stroke volume measurements, or the variations in systolic pressure, pulse
pressure, or stroke volume to changes in intrathoracic pressure induced by mechanical ventilation (24). Our
review of five studies of the use of pulse pressure variation to predict fluid responsiveness in patients with
sepsis or septic shock demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.61–0.81) and a specificity of 0.91 (95%
CI, 0.83–0.95); the quality of evidence was low due to imprecision and risk of bias ( **Supplemental Digital**
**Content 3**, htp://links.lww.com/CCM/C324) (24). A recent multi-centre study demonstrated limited use
of cardiac function monitors during fluid administration in the ICUs. Even though data on the use of these
monitors in the emergency department are lacking, the availability of the devices and applicability of the
parameters to all situations may influence the routine use of dynamic indices (22, 25).

MAP is the driving pressure of tissue perfusion. While perfusion of critical organs such as the brain or kidney
may be protected from systemic hypotension by autoregulation of regional perfusion, below a threshold MAP,
tissue perfusion becomes linearly dependent on arterial pressure. In a single-centre trial (26), dose titration of
norepinephrine from 65 to 75 and 85 mm Hg raised cardiac index (from 4.7 ± 0.5 to 5.5 ± 0.6 L/min/m2) but
did not change urinary flow, arterial lactate levels, oxygen delivery and consumption, gastric mucosal Pco2,
RBC velocity, or skin capillary flow. Another single-centre (27) trial compared, in norepinephrine-treated septic
shock, dose titration to maintain MAP at 65 mmHg versus achieving 85 mmHg. In this trial, targeting high MAP
increased cardiac index from 4.8 (3.8–6.0) to 5.8 (4.3–6.9) L/min/m2 but did not change renal function, arterial
lactate levels, or oxygen consumption. A third single-centre trial (28) found improved microcirculation, as
assessed by sublingual vessel density and the ascending slope of thenar oxygen saturation after an occlusion
test, by titrating norepinephrine to a MAP of 85 mm Hg compared to 65 mm Hg. Only one multi-centre trial
that compared norepinephrine dose titration to achieve a MAP of 65 mm Hg versus 85 mm Hg had mortality
as a primary outcome (29). There was no significant difference in mortality at 28 days (36.6% in the high-target
group and 34.0% in the low-target group) or 90 days (43.8% in the high-target group and 42.3% in the low target
group). Targeting a MAP of 85 mm Hg resulted in a significantly higher risk of arrhythmias, but the subgroup
of patients with previously diagnosed chronic hypertension had a reduced need for renal replacement therapy
(RRT) at this higher MAP. A recent pilot trial of 118 septic shock patients (30) suggested that, in the subgroup of
patients older than 75 years, mortality was reduced when targeting a MAP of 60–65 mm Hg versus 75–80 mm
Hg. The quality of evidence was moderate ( **Supplemental Digital Content 4**, htp://links.lww.com/CCM/C325)
due to imprecise estimates (wide confidence intervals). As a result, the desirable consequences of targeting
MAP of 65 mm Hg (lower risk of atrial fibrillation, lower doses of vasopressors, and similar mortality) led to a
strong recommendation favouring an initial MAP target of 65 mm Hg over higher MAP targets. When a better
understanding of any patient’s condition is obtained, this target should be individualized to the pertaining
circumstances.


Serum lactate is not a direct measure of tissue perfusion (31). Increases in the serum lactate level may represent
tissue hypoxia, accelerated aerobic glycolysis driven by excess beta-adrenergic stimulation, or other causes
(e.g., liver failure). Regardless of the source, increased lactate levels are associated with worse outcomes (32).
Because lactate is a standard laboratory test with prescribed techniques for its measurement, it may serve
as a more objective surrogate for tissue perfusion as compared with physical examination or urine output.
Five randomized controlled trials (647 patients) have evaluated lactate-guided resuscitation of patients with
septic shock (33–37). A significant reduction in mortality was seen in lactate-guided resuscitation compared
to resuscitation without lactate monitoring (RR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53–0.84; low quality). There was no evidence
for difference in ICU length of stay (LOS) (mean difference –1.51 days; 95% CI, –3.65 to 0.62; low quality). Two
other meta-analyses of the 647 patients who were enrolled in these trials demonstrate moderate evidence for
reduction in mortality when an early lactate clearance strategy was used, compared with either usual care (nonspecified) or with a Scvo2 normalization strategy (38, 39).


The use of IV fluids in the resuscitation of patients is a cornerstone of modern therapy. Despite this, there is
little available evidence from RCTs to support its practice; this is an area in which research is urgently needed.
One trial of children (mostly with malaria) in Africa, in a setting where escalation to mechanical ventilation and
other organ support was limited, questioned this practice (230). We believe that the extrapolation of these data
to patients in better-resourced settings is not valid and thus recommend that clinicians restore euvolemia with
IV fluids, more urgently initially, and then more cautiously as the patient stabilizes. There is some evidence that
a sustained positive fluid balance during ICU stay is harmful (231-235). We do not recommend, therefore, that
fluid be given beyond initial resuscitation without some estimate of the likelihood that the patient will respond
positively.

The absence of any clear benefit following the administration of colloid compared to crystalloid solutions in the
combined subgroups of sepsis, in conjunction with the expense of albumin, supports a strong recommendation
for the use of crystalloid solutions in the initial resuscitation of patients with sepsis and septic shock.


We were unable to recommend one crystalloid solution over another because no direct comparisons have been
made between isotonic saline and balanced salt solutions in patients with sepsis. One before-after study in all
ICU patients suggested increased rates of acute kidney injury and RRT in patients managed with a chloride-liberal
strategy compared to a chloride-restrictive strategy (236). There is indirect low-quality evidence from a network
meta-analysis suggesting improved outcome with balanced salt solutions as compared to saline in patients
with sepsis (237)(Supplemental Digital Content 6, htp://links.lww.com/CCM/C327). In addition, the neutral
result of the SPLIT cluster RCT in ICU patients (mainly surgical patients) in four New Zealand ICUs lowered our
confidence in recommending one solution over the other (238). No cost-effectiveness studies compare balanced
and unbalanced crystalloid solutions. Therefore, we considered the desirable and undesirable consequences to
be comparable for both solutions and issued a weak recommendation to use either solution. Hyperchloremia
should be avoided, however, and thus close scrutiny of serum chloride levels is advised, whichever fluid solutions
are used.


The SAFE study indicated that albumin administration was safe and equally effective as 0.9% saline in ICU
patients requiring fluid administration (239). A meta-analysis aggregated data from 17 randomized trials (n =
1,977) of albumin versus other fluid solutions in patients with sepsis or septic shock (240); 279 deaths occurred
among 961 albumin-treated patients (29%) versus 343 deaths among 1,016 patients (34%) treated with other
fluids, favouring albumin (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67–1.00). When albumin-treated patients were compared with
those receiving crystalloids (seven trials, n = 144), the odds ratio of dying was significantly reduced for albumintreated patients (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62–0.99).


Since the 2012 SSC guideline publication, six systematic reviews/meta-analyses (237,241-245) were published
assessing the use of albumin solutions in the management of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Each metaanalysis included different populations (adult/child, septic/nonseptic, and acute resuscitation/maintenance),
different comparators and different duration of exposure to the intervention (hours, days), which made
combining data challenging (Supplemental Digital Content 7, htp://links.lww.com/CCM/C328).


Xu et al. (242) evaluated albumin compared to crystalloid as a resuscitation fluid. Five studies, encompassing
3,658 sepsis and 2,180 septic shock patients, were included. Albumin use resulted in reduced septic shock
90-day mortality (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67–0.97) and trended toward reduced 90-day mortality in sepsis (OR,
0.88; 95% CI, 0.76–1.01; p = 0.08). Jiang et al. (245) evaluated albumin in a mixed population of sepsis severity
including adults and children. Three septic shock studies, encompassing 1,931 patients, were included. Albumin
use resulted in decreased mortality (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80–0.99) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). A mortality
reduction trend was reported for albumin administration compared to crystalloids when given less than 6 hours
from identification (11 studies; n = 5515; OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.86–1.03).


Patel et al. (244) evaluated mixed populations, including resuscitation and maintenance. Additionally, a series
of studies excluded from other meta-analyses due to accuracy concerns was included in this evaluation (246248). When comparing crystalloid and albumin, the authors report a combined mortality benefit of albumin
as compared to crystalloid (7 studies, n = 3,878; OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86–1.00), but it was not consistent across
individual severity subgroups. Use of albumin in septic shock trended toward mortality benefit (4 studies; n =
1,949; OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.82–1.01; p = 0.06), and the use of albumin in sepsis was not significant (4 studies; n
= 1,929; OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83–1.10). Evaluation of treatment within 24 hours also trended toward mortality
benefit (4 studies; n = 3,832; RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86–1.01). Rochwerg et al. (2014) (237) evaluated resuscitative
fluid use in a network meta-analysis of 14 trials, encompassing 18,916 patients. When comparing albumin to
crystalloid, there was no significant reduction in mortality with moderate quality of evidence in both the four

| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **55**


and six-node analyses (four-node: OR, 0.83; credible interval [CrI] 0.65–1.04; six-node OR 0.82; Crl 0.65–1.04).
The ALBIOS trial (249) showed no mortality benefit of albumin in combination with crystalloids compared to
crystalloids alone in patients with sepsis or septic shock (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85–1.05); a subgroup analysis
suggested that the albumin group was associated with lower 90-day mortality in patients with septic shock (RR,
0.87; 95% CI, 0.77–0.99). Fluid administration continued for 28 days or until discharge and was not targeted
for acute resuscitation. In addition, the amount of 20% albumin was guided by serum albumin level with the
ultimate goal of achieving levels > 30 g/L. These results are limited by significant indirectness and imprecision,
resulting in low quality of evidence.


HESs are colloids for which there are safety concerns in patients with sepsis. A meta-analysis of nine trials (3,456
patients) comparing 6% HES 130/0.38–0.45 solutions to crystalloids or albumin in patients with sepsis showed
no difference in all-cause mortality (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.89–1.22) (250). However, when low risk of bias trials
were analysed separately, HES use resulted in higher risk of death compared to other fluids (RR, 1.11; 95% CI,
1.01–1.22; high-quality evidence), which translates to 34 more deaths per 1,000 patients. Furthermore, HES
use led to a higher risk of RRT (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08–1.72; high-quality evidence) (250). A subsequent network
meta-analysis focused on acute resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock and found that HES resulted
in higher risk of death (10 RCTs; OR, 1.13; CrI, 0.99–1.30; high-quality evidence) and need for RRT (7 RCTs; OR,
1.39; CrI, 1.17–1.66; high-quality evidence) compared to crystalloids. When comparing albumin to HES, albumin
resulted in lower risk of death (OR, 0.73; CrI, 0.56–0.93; moderate-quality evidence) and a trend toward less
need for RRT (OR, 0.74; CrI, 0.53–1.04; low-quality evidence) (237). Overall, the undesirable consequences of
using HES (increased risk of death and need for RRT) along with moderate to high quality of available evidence
resulted in a strong recommendation against the use of HES in resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic
shock.


Gelatin is another synthetic colloid that can be used for fluid resuscitation; however, high-quality studies
comparing gelatins to other fluids in patients with sepsis or septic shock are lacking. Trials conducted in critically
ill patients were summarized in a recent meta-analysis (251). Gelatin use in critically ill adult patients did
not increase mortality (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.85–1.43; low-quality evidence) or acute kidney injury (RR, 1.35;
95% CI, 0.58–3.14; very low-quality evidence) compared to albumin or crystalloid. These results are limited
by indirectness, since the studies did not focus on critically ill patients. The aforementioned network metaanalysis by Rochwerg et al did not identify any RCTs comparing gelatins to crystalloids or albumin; therefore,
the generated estimates were imprecise and were based on indirect comparisons (237). Given the low quality
of the available data and the cost associated with gelatin use, we issued a weak recommendation favoring the
use of crystalloids over gelatins.

output, and others, as available) as well as other non-invasive or invasive monitoring, as available.


**Implementation Point 4 (Recommendations 2-9)**

**Sepsis 6 bundle**
**Initial treatment:** Following medical review, patients with a history and examination suggestive of systemic
infection **and** who were identified as being in one of the three high-risk group for mortality from sepsis, should
be given the Sepsis 6 bundle, and have their initial response reviewed with results of tests and investigations,
within one hour of this differential diagnosis (i.e. TIME ZERO). Patients who present in extremis, for example,
with profound hypotension, respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support and/or purpuric rash should receive
the Sepsis 6 bundle immediately.


 - Patients, with a clinical suspicion of infection who have screened as high risk of mortality from sepsis
should have the Sepsis 6 bundle of care completed within one hour of a medical review.

 - For patients who present with clinically apparent sepsis/septic shock, it is recommended that the Sepsis 6
bundle be administered within **1 hour of presentation (Levy et al., 2018)**

 - A time-limited course of rapid investigations should be undertaken and if concern for infection persists
when clinical and laboratory data is reviewed, the administration of antimicrobials should be completed
within 3 hours of Time Zero. **[new 2025]**


A time-dependent bundled approach to sepsis resuscitation facilitates compliance with SSCG recommendations 1-3.


**Roles and Responsibilities**
All clinicians (medical, midwifery and nursing) should be familiar with the Sepsis 6 treatment bundle; they
should work together to ensure that patients, who on history and examination have a suspicion of infection and
are identified by screening as high risk of mortality from sepsis, receive the components of the Sepsis 6 bundle
completed and reviewed correctly and within 1 hour of differential diagnosis.

**Take 3:** Three diagnostic interventions





1. **Blood cultures:** Take using aseptic (non-touch) technique before the first dose of antimicrobials unless it
will delay administering the antimicrobial therapy for more than 45 minutes. If a central venous catheter is
in situ, blood cultures should also be taken through that line. Other specimens should be sent as clinically
indicated e.g. influenza swabs, wound swabs, sputum, urine etc.


**SSCG remarks that appropriate routine microbiologic cultures always include at least two sets of blood**
**cultures (aerobic and anaerobic).**


2. **Blood tests:** send blood for a full blood count, renal profile and liver profile tests and do a Point of care
lactate (venous or arterial). These tests help support an infection diagnosis and identify any acute organ
dysfunction as its consequence. Other tests and investigations to assess the patient and aid in diagnosis
should be according to the clinical assessment and based on usual management.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **59**


3. **Urine output:** assessing and quantifying urinary output is part of diagnosing a fluid deficit and response
to resuscitation. This does not require all patients to have a urinary catheter. A urinary catheter may be
necessary, however, for patients who are sick enough to warrant fluid resuscitation and ongoing hourly
urinary output monitoring.


**Give 3: three therapeutic interventions:**


4. **Oxygen:** supplementary oxygen is administered to ensure oxygen saturation levels are between 94 – 96%
(PaO2 ≥ 10kPa) or 88 – 92% (PaO2 ≥ 8kPa) in patients with chronic lung disease. A recent meta-analysis on
oxygen therapy indicates an increased mortality when aiming for SpO2 of above 96%. (Chu et al., 2018).

5. **Fluids:** For patients with hypotension or hypoperfusion give a 250 - 500mls IV fluid bolus of balanced
crystalloid. Administer a total volume of fluid resuscitation up to 30ml/kg within the first 3 hours unless
fluid intolerant or the patients clinical condition requires earlier referral to critical care for consideration of
inotropes/vasopressors. Reassess response to fluid resuscitation frequently. **[updated 2025]**

6. (Refer to Appendix 13 fluid resuscitation algorithm for adults with sepsis). Patients who present with
hypotension should receive at least 30mls/kg intravenous isotonic crystalloid fluid with the aim of restoring
tissue perfusion. Patients, with hypotension, who are fluid intolerant or fluid resistant should have a critical
care review with respect to invasive monitoring and advanced cardiorespiratory support. **[updated 2025]**

Apply vasopressors if the patient is hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain mean arterial
pressure (MAP) ≥ 65mmHg.

Fluid administration to high-risk patients with infection who present without hypotension should be based
on clinical need. The patient’s volume status should be assessed by reviewing their heart rate, blood
pressure, urinary output and Point of Care lactate (venous or arterial). If a deficit is diagnosed, it should be
corrected using a bolus and review method. This entails administering boluses of 500mls isotonic crystalloid
given over 15 minutes followed by a prompt review to see if the patient needs further fluid or is showing
signs of overload. A fluid balance chart should be commenced to monitor input and output in patients who
require ongoing fluid resuscitation. A patient with no deficit or whose deficit has been corrected needs no
further fluid. Exercise professional judgment in patients who due to chronic health issues are at high risk
of fluid overload. Consider 250ml boluses and more frequent review in such cases. A fluid resuscitation
algorithm for non-critical care specialists is available in Appendix 13. A fluid balance chart should be started
to monitor hourly input and output in patients who require fluid resuscitation.

7 **Antimicrobials and Source Control** : Appropriate antimicrobials should be administered according to local
antimicrobial guidelines. Refer to Section D: Antimicrobial therapy for further information. Antimicrobials
can only work if there is a blood supply to the source, therefore review the need for source control. See
Section E: Source Control for further information.


**Maternity only**
All clinicians (medical, midwifery and nursing) should be familiar with the adapted Sepsis 6+1 treatment bundle.
They should work together to ensure that patients, who on history and examination have infection and who
are identified by screening as at risk of sepsis, receive the components of the Sepsis 6+1 bundle, completed
correctly and within 1 hour of diagnosis.

**Antimicrobials specific to maternal shock**
For acute maternal septic shock, as defined by the current HSE maternal sepsis form, empirical antibiotics should
be administered within 1 hour. In patients with no penicillin allergy reported, in line with international and national
guidance above, three antimicrobials should be given in setting of acute maternal septic shock (RCPI, 2017):
a. Broad spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial (Meropenem is recommended in to cover for extended spectrum
beta-lactamases, (RCOG also give piperacillin/tazobactam as an option) (RCOG, 2012).
b. Gentamicin: This is for bactericidal action against Gram-negative organisms mainly.
c. Clindamycin: This is to switch off exotoxin production with significantly decreased mortality (RCOG, 2012).
d. A combination of either piperacillin/tazobactam or carbapenem PLUS clindamycin provides one of the
broadest ranges of treatment for sepsis (RCOG, 2012).
If there is a strong suspicion clinically that the septic shock may be relating to group A Streptococcus,
then IV immunoglobulin (HPSC, 2006), could be considered in line with the national Group A Streptococcal
management guidelines which were produced by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).
If MRSA is present, always give vancomycin in addition to the other antimicrobials (RCPI, 2017).


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **61**


**+ 1: Fetal wellbeing**
Resuscitating the mother will resuscitate the baby, however, it is important to assess fetal wellbeing and formulate
a plan for delivery if required. Maternal sepsis with or without haemodynamic instability may present with fetal
distress as the uteroplacental circulation is not auto-regulated (Chau, 2014). Thus, any maternal circulatory
insufficiency arising from sepsis may result in compromised fetal perfusion.


Management plans need to take into consideration the altered immunological response of the woman and the
altered physiological responses during pregnancy (Mor and Cardenas, 2010). Particular consideration needs to
be taken of the physiological effects of anaesthesia, general and regional, on the pregnant septic women.


**Implementation Point 5 (Recommendations 10-14)**
For clarification, recommendations 10 and 11 refer to different time points in the patient’s journey under the
care of two different teams. Recommendation 10 is applicable to patients in the ED or ward i.e. where initial
resuscitation takes place and Recommendation 11 is applicable to patients in the ICU.
Patients who present with shock should receive 30mls/kg of intravenous balanced crystalloid fluid and
vasopressors started in those with fluid resistant shock within one hour of presentation (Levy et al., 2018).


The initial resuscitation of patients with tissue hypo-perfusion may be guided by physiological parameters
such as normalisation of mental status, skin perfusion, blood pressure, urinary output and Point of care lactate
(venous or arterial) measurement. A fluid resuscitation algorithm outlining the fluid bolus and review method to
initial resuscitation is available (Appendix 13). Four potential scenarios need to be considered after each bolus.


1. Persistent hypoperfusion: continue fluid resuscitation.

2. Fluid intolerant:

a. Persistent hypoperfusion, as evidenced by hypotension and/or raised lactate with clinical signs of
overload. These patients should have a critical care review and consideration for inotropes and invasive
monitoring for fluid responsiveness. Forced diuresis is unlikely to be helpful and may be harmful in this
group due to ongoing intra-vascular hypovolaemia.
b. Normotension with signs of overload, these patients may benefit from diuresis. Before giving the diuretic
check the patient’s perfusion.
3. Fluid resistant: these patients have no or transient improvement in physiological parameters with fluid
resuscitation due to a high degree of vascular leak, vasoplegia +/- cardiac impairment and require
vasopressors and/or inotropes and invasive monitoring of fluid responsiveness with critical care input.

4. Fluid replete – the fluid deficit has been corrected, stop fluid resuscitation.


In certain patient populations, such as those with chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure and frailty,
lead clinicians may be reluctant to administer intravenous fluid to avoid causing harm. However, these patients
if they have an infection-induced perfusion deficit require restoration of tissue perfusion to avert progressive
organ dysfunction and reduce mortality. Taking a bolus approach allows good control of resuscitation and early
detection of signs of overload. Exercise clinical judgment and, if clinically indicated use smaller boluses e.g.
250mls with more frequent review.


**Maternity only**
Pulmonary vascular resistance decreases during pregnancy. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central
venous pressure do not change during pregnancy, but serum colloid pressure is reduced by 10% to 15%,
predisposing pregnant women to an increased risk of pulmonary oedema (Soma-Pillay et al., 2016).


Normal physiologic changes of pregnancy cause a reduction in colloid oncotic pressures (Price et al., 2008),
allowing interstitial fluid shifts to occur and placing obstetric patients at risk of developing pulmonary oedema
and acute respiratory distress syndrome


**62** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



**Roles and responsibilities:**
All clinicians should be familiar with the fluid resuscitation algorithm and the use of the bolus and review
approach to fluid resuscitation and that, unless otherwise indicated, isotonic crystalloid is the fluid of choice1.
They should be aware of the importance of exercising clinical judgement to use smaller boluses when clinically
indicated.


**Implementation Point 6**

**Sepsis Diagnosis**
Sepsis is diagnosed when acute organ dysfunction consequent to infection occurs. This diagnosis can be made
before or after the Sepsis 6 bundle depending on whether the organ dysfunction is diagnosed clinically or based
on the laboratory results. This includes acute on chronic organ dysfunction.
As the SSC guidelines were being developed, new definitions for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3) were
published. Sepsis is now defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response
to infection. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction associated
with a higher risk of mortality (Singer et al., 2016).


Infection, sepsis and septic shock are clinical diagnoses. There is no one test that will confirm the presence of
infection, sepsis or septic shock to the exclusion of other diagnoses. Rather the suite of symptoms and signs
along with tests and investigations need to be weighed against the differential diagnoses and a clinical decision
made. The presence of positive cultures does much to support an infective aetiology but only occurs in 40-60%
of sepsis cases, (Martin et al., 2003) (Brun-Buisson et al., 1995) (Phua et al., 2013),and has a time lag to positivity.
Much has been made of the removal of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria from
the definition of sepsis, however, this does not mean that SIRS has ‘gone away’ it reflects the fact that selflimiting non-life threatening infections may present with SIRS and that SIRS may be caused by infectious and
non-infectious insults.


SIRS in non-pregnant adults include:

 - Heart rate > 90 beats/minute

 - Respiratory rate > 20 breaths/minute

 - Temperature > 38.3°C or < 36°C

 - White cell count > 12 or < 4 x 109 cells/L or normal with > 10% immature forms.

 - Bedside glucose >7.7mmol/L in the absence of diabetes mellitus.

The presence of a SIRS response is not required for the diagnosis of sepsis to be made but, in fact, it is present
in 86.7% of critical care sepsis patients (Raith et al., 2017). The SIRS criteria continue to be helpful in identifying
patients with infection.

**Note:** Patients with immunocompromise may not manifest the usual signs and symptoms of infection due to their inability to
mount the appropriate immune response. These patients often present unwell with evidence of new onset organ dysfunction.
They may have no temperature and mount no white cell increase. A high index of suspicion must be deployed to diagnose these
patients correctly and a presumption of infection and treatment with empiric antimicrobial therapy is recommended until the
diagnosis is confirmed.


**Maternity only**
Obstetric patients with infections may present with nonspecific symptoms and early investigation is necessary
to exclude severe infection (Mor and Cardenas, 2010).

 - History of fevers or rigors

 - Cough/sputum/breathlessness

 - Flu-like symptoms

 - Unexplained abdominal pain/distension

 - Pelvic pain

 - Vomiting and/or diarrhoea

Note: Women with severe immuno-compromise may not manifest the usual signs and symptoms of infection
due to their inability to mount the appropriate immune response. These women often present unwell with
evidence of new onset organ dysfunction. They may have no temperature and mount no white cell increase. A
high index of suspicion must be deployed to diagnose these women correctly and a presumption of infection
and treatment with empiric antimicrobial therapy is recommended until the diagnosis is confirmed.


**Organ dysfunction criteria:**

Organ dysfunction is identified if one or more of the following is diagnosed either on the blood tests sent as part of
the Sepsis 6 bundle OR persisting clinically after the bundle has been administered. This is outlined in Table 17.


**Table 17.** Evidence of organ dysfunction






|Central Nervous System<br>Acutely altered mental status|Respiratory<br>New need for oxygen to achieve saturation > 90%<br>(note: this is a definition not the target)|

The Sepsis Definition Taskforce (Singer et al., 2016) recommends the use of the SOFA score to assess for the
presence of acute organ dysfunction. Two sepsis forms were trialled by the National Sepsis Team; one using
the organ dysfunction list (Fig. 11) (Section 7 Sepsis Form Appendix 9) and the other using the SOFA score (Fig
12) (Singer et al., 2016). Twelve Emergency Departments, nationally, participated in a PDSA cycle to inform the
format. Whilst Consultants preferred the SOFA score, Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs) and nurses
preferred the list of organ dysfunctions (NSP, 2016). As NCHDs are, by far, the more likely first treating clinicians
we suggest continuing to use the list, which has been adapted to reflect the SOFA tool. The SOFA score may
equally be used, if preferred.

**Figure 12.** The Sepsis Sofa Score
**(Singer et al., 2016)**


**66** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Previously the NEWS scoring system was not sensitive for new onset confusion or agitation as both these
conditions may be scored as ‘Alert’. INEWS 2020 addresses this deficit as it contains and additional parameter
to assess new onset confusion (ACVPU/CNS response – Alert, New Confusion, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive). In
conditions where infection is thought to contribute to the deterioration of a patients’ clinical status professional
judgment should be exercised and sepsis screening performed.


Singer et al. (2016) described a simplified method to facilitate easier identification of patients potentially at risk
of dying from sepsis termed “quick SOFA”. This score is a modified version of SOFA and consists of only three
components (RR ≥22/min, Altered Mental Status and SBP ≤100 mmHg) that are each allocated one point.  A
qSOFA score of ≥2 points was deemed to indicate organ dysfunction. However, Marik & Taeb (2017) state that
use of qSOFA score risks missing early identification of sepsis when treatment is most effective (Marik and Taeb,
2017). In addition, the National Sepsis Programme does not support the use of the qSOFA score to identify
patients with sepsis, as it was not developed as a diagnostic tool but rather as a prognostic indicator in patients
with sepsis (Goulden et al., 2018) (Churpek et al., 2017)


**Roles and responsibilities:**
It is the responsibility of all clinicians in the acute hospital sector to be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for
sepsis and septic shock.


**Septic Shock Diagnosis**
Septic shock is diagnosed if vasopressors or inotropes are required to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure
(MAP) > 65mmHg and the patient has evidence of tissue hypoperfusion after adequate fluid resuscitation.

**Implementation Point 7 (Recommendation 7)**
The sepsis-3 definition taskforce (Singer et al., 2016) have defined septic shock as requiring vasopressors to
maintain a MAP > 65mmHg AND a lactate ≥ 2mmol/L after adequate fluid resuscitation. This identifies a cohort
of patients with a mortality risk > 40% versus > 30% in those with a pressor requirement and a normal lactate.
Patients who require vasopressors or inotropes to support their blood pressure after appropriate fluid
resuscitation require critical care review. Adequate fluid resuscitation, for the purpose of this guideline, is a
minimum of 30mls/kg intravenous crystalloid or that the patient is fluid intolerant. Patients with a persistent
lactate > 4mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation who are maintaining a MAP > 65mmHg have a high
mortality risk and as such may benefit from critical care review despite not fulfilling shock criteria.

**Figure 13.** Adult Sepsis Pathway



















**Figure 14.** Maternity Sepsis Pathway


**Implementation Point 8**
Having administered the Sepsis 6 bundle, the patient should be reviewed with the results of the tests and
investigations sent as a consequence of their medical review.


This review should be performed within 1 hour of Time Zero but may be performed earlier and as frequently as
clinically indicated. This provides the first opportunity to review the working diagnosis and treatment. If a noninfective aetiology for the patients’ presentation has been identified, stop antimicrobials.


If the investigations have localised the site of infection, review antimicrobial prescription using the local
antimicrobial guidelines to ensure it is the most appropriate choice. If not already reviewed when empiric
antimicrobial therapy was prescribed, review patients past microbiology results, as a previous history of multidrug resistant organisms may influence choice of antimicrobial. Complex cases may benefit from Clinical
Microbiology/ Infectious diseases review.


**68** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Source control is a vital component of the treatment of infection. Organise for drainage/ debridement to be
performed as soon as practicable.


Suggested components of the review:


**Clinical assessment:**

**• Assess clinical response to Sepsis 6 bundle**

  - Has your patient improved, stabilised or deteriorated?

  - Is there clinical evidence of acute organ dysfunction?

**• Review blood tests**

  - Do they support an infective aetiology?

  - Are there abnormalities in the biochemical profile with evidence of acute organ dysfunction?

**• Review other tests and investigations ordered and completed**

  - Do they support an infective aetiology?

  - Is source control required?

**• Perform repeat Point of Care lactate (venous or arterial)**

   - If clinically indicated or if the first was > 2mmol/l in order to monitor restoration of tissue perfusion and/
or guide on-going fluid resuscitation. Note: a normal Lactate does not exclude sepsis
**Actions**

 - Seek senior input if patient is not stabilized or improving.

 - Document the diagnosis as infection, sepsis, or septic shock and amend treatment plan accordingly.

 - Obtain critical care review for patients with septic shock and/or other organ dysfunctions requiring support.

 - Review differential diagnoses.


**Maternity only**
In a very unwell or unstable patient it is not usual to have a definitive diagnosis in the first instance. If infection is
on the differential give the Sepsis 6+1 and if a non-infective aetiology is subsequently found, stop the antibiotics.

**Roles and responsibilities:**
It is the responsibility of the treating clinician to review the patients’ clinical response to the Sepsis 6 bundle of
care, the results of the tests ordered, to diagnose and document sepsis as appropriate and to escalate the patient
for specialist intervention as indicated. In the circumstance where the treating clinician changes during the
care episode; clear transfer of responsibility should be made and documented, outlining outstanding tasks and
concerns and the name(s) of the clinicians taking over care (NCEC, 2015a). The relevant Sepsis Form (Appendix
9) or ISBAR Communication Tool (Appendix 14) can be used for this. The ISBAR communication tool can be used
to structure this communication. National clinical guidelines No 5 and 11 provide guidance on communication
in both maternity and acute hospital service for adult and children, (NCEC 2014, NCEC 2015).


This information should also be communicated to other clinicians involved in the patients’ immediate care.
It is the responsibility of the HSE, Hospital Group Leadership and Hospital Management to ensure adequate
resources are available for tests and investigations to be performed in a timely manner and for capacity to be
available for escalation to critical care when required.


**70** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



**Maternity only**
It is the responsibility of the midwife to screen for the possibility of sepsis in a woman presenting with symptoms
suggestive of infection and to initiate the sepsis form in women who screen positive, then to escalate to urgent
medical review and to communicate current concerns and relevant clinical history in line with the Maternity
Sepsis Form and ISBAR. It is also their responsibility to assist with the timely delivery of the Sepsis 6 + 1 bundle,
subsequent monitoring, care and escalation in line with the maternity sepsis form and IMEWS.


It is the responsibility of the treating clinicians to review the woman’s clinical response to the sepsis 6+1 bundle
of care and the results of the tests ordered and to diagnose and document sepsis as appropriate and to escalate
the woman for specialist intervention as indicated.


**When should a patient be escalated for critical care review?**
Initial assessment of a patient presenting unwell or deteriorating should include review of airway, breathing,
circulation and neurological status.


 - Patients who need immediate airway management and/or ventilatory support and/or have fluid resistant
or profound shock and/ or have a purpuric rash should be escalated to critical care review.

 - Patients who despite adequate fluid resuscitation* have not achieved a mean arterial pressure of ≥
65mmHg should be referred to critical care.


_*For the purposes of this guideline adequate fluid resuscitation in patients presenting with hypotension is a minimum of 30mls/_
_kg of isotonic crystalloid fluid unless the patient is or becomes fluid intolerant as evidenced by worsening cardio-respiratory status_
_and/or oedema._


**What are the goals of critical care?**
The goals of critical care management are to support organ function during the diagnosis and treatment of
reversible disease processes, in this instance sepsis, whilst minimizing nosocomial injury. It is recommended
that this management be guided by evidence-based regimes as outlined by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign
Guideline adopted in this document.


**3.1.3 Antimicrobial therapy**

**Key questions**

 - In patients with sepsis, should we use broad empiric antimicrobial coverage?

 - In patients with septic shock, should we administer empirically appropriate antimicrobials (within one hour
of recognition)?

 - In patients with sepsis, should we administer empirically appropriate antimicrobials (within one hour of
recognition)?

 - In critically ill septic patients, should we implement pharmacokinetic dosing optimization for each
antimicrobial?

 - In patients with sepsis and neutropenia, should we use empiric combination antimicrobial therapy versus
mono-therapy?

 - In patients with sepsis at high risk for multi-drug resistant pathogens, should we use empiric combination
antibiotic therapy (versus mono-therapy) until sensitivities are determined?

 - In patients with septic shock, should we use empiric double-coverage antibiotic agents until hemodynamic
stabilization and pathogen identification?

 - In patients with sepsis who are receiving antimicrobials, should we assess for de-escalation of therapy
daily?

 - In patients with uncomplicated infections causing sepsis or septic shock, should we recommend a duration
of therapy of 7-10 days versus longer course?


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **71**


 - In patients with sepsis or septic shock who are receiving empiric combination of antimicrobials should we
assess for de-escalation of therapy daily?

 - In patients with sepsis, should we use procalcitonin levels to support de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy?

 - In patients with severe inflammatory state of non-infectious origin should we use systemic prophylactic
antimicrobials.


**SSCG Rationale**


The rapidity of administration is central to the beneficial effect of appropriate antimicrobials. In the presence
of sepsis or septic shock, each hour delay in administration of appropriate antimicrobials is associated with a
measurable increase in mortality (57,74). Further, several studies show an adverse effect on secondary end points
(e.g., LOS (75), acute kidney injury (76), acute lung injury (77), and organ injury assessed by Sepsis-Related Organ
Assessment score (78) with increasing delays. Despite a meta-analysis of mostly poor-quality studies that failed
to demonstrate a benefit of rapid antimicrobial therapy, the largest and highest-quality studies support giving
appropriate antimicrobials as soon as possible in patients with sepsis with or without septic shock (57,74,79-81)
The majority of studies within the meta-analysis were of low quality due to a number of deficiencies, including
small study size, using an initial index time of an arbitrary time point such as emergency department arrival,
and indexing of outcome to delay in time to the first antimicrobial (regardless of activity against the putative
pathogen)(82,83). Other negative studies not included in this meta-analysis are compromised by equating
bacteraemia with sepsis (as currently defined to include organ failure) and septic shock (84-87). Many of these
studies are also compromised by indexing delays to easily accessible but non-physiologic variables such as time
of initial blood culture draw (an event likely to be highly variable in timing occurrence).


While available data suggest that the earliest possible administration of appropriate IV antimicrobials following
recognition of sepsis or septic shock yields optimal outcomes, one hour is recommended as a reasonable
minimal target. The feasibility of achieving this target consistently, however, has not been adequately assessed.
Practical considerations, for example, challenges with clinicians’ early identification of patients or operational
complexities in the drug delivery chain, represent poorly studied variables that may affect achieving this goal. A
number of patient and organizational factors appear to influence antimicrobial delays (88).


Accelerating appropriate antimicrobial delivery institutionally starts with an assessment of causes of delays
(89). These can include an unacceptably high frequency of failure to recognize the potential existence of
sepsis or septic shock and of inappropriate empiric antimicrobial initiation (e.g., as a consequence of lack of
appreciation of the potential for microbial resistance or recent previous antimicrobial use in a given patient).
In addition, unrecognized or underappreciated administrative or logistic factors (often easily remedied) may
be found. Possible solutions to delays in antimicrobial initiation include use of “stat” orders or including a
minimal time element in antimicrobial orders, addressing delays in obtaining blood and site cultures pending
antimicrobial administration, and sequencing antimicrobial delivery optimally or using simultaneous delivery of
key antimicrobials, as well as improving supply chain deficiencies. Improving communication among medical,
pharmacy, and nursing staff can also be highly beneficial.


Most issues can be addressed by quality improvement initiatives, including defined order sets. If antimicrobial
agents cannot be mixed and delivered promptly from the pharmacy, establishing a supply of premixed drugs for
urgent situations is an appropriate strategy for ensuring prompt administration. Many antimicrobials will not
remain stable if premixed in a solution. This issue must be taken into consideration in institutions that rely on
premixed solutions for rapid antimicrobial availability. In choosing the antimicrobial regimen, clinicians should
be aware that some antimicrobial agents (notably β-lactams) have the advantage of being able to be safely
administered as a bolus or rapid infusion, while others require a lengthy infusion.


**72** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



If vascular access is limited and many different agents must be infused, drugs that can be administered as a
bolus or rapid infusion may offer an advantage for rapid achievement of therapeutic levels for the initial dose.


While establishing vascular access and initiating aggressive fluid resuscitation are very important when
managing patients with sepsis or septic shock, prompt IV infusion of antimicrobial agents is also a priority. This
may require additional vascular access ports. Intraosseous access, which can be quickly and reliably established
(even in adults), can be used to rapidly administer the initial doses of any antimicrobial (90,91). In addition,
intramuscular preparations are approved and available for several first-line β-lactams, including imipenem/
cilastatin, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ertapenem. Several additional first-line β-lactams can also be effectively
administered intramuscularly in emergency situations if vascular and intraosseous access is unavailable, although
regulatory approval for intramuscular administration for these drugs is lacking (92-94). Intramuscular absorption
and distribution of some of these agents in severe illness has not been studied; intramuscular administration
should be considered only if timely establishment of vascular access is not possible.


The initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e., with activity against the causative pathogen or pathogens)
is one of the most important facets of effective management of life-threatening infections causing sepsis and
septic shock. Failure to initiate appropriate empiric therapy in patients with sepsis and septic shock is associated
with a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality (79, 95-97). In addition, the probability of progression
from gram-negative bacteremic infection to septic shock is increased (98). Accordingly, the initial selection of
antimicrobial therapy must be broad enough to cover all likely pathogens. The choice of empiric antimicrobial
therapy depends on complex issues related to the patient’s history, clinical status, and local epidemiologic
factors. Key patient factors include the nature of the clinical syndrome/site of infection, concomitant underlying
diseases, chronic organ failures, medications, indwelling devices, the presence of immunosuppression or other
form of immunocompromise, recent known infection or colonization with specific pathogens, and the receipt
of antimicrobials within the previous three months. In addition, the patient’s location at the time of infection
acquisition (i.e., community, chronic care institution, acute care hospital), local pathogen prevalence, and the
susceptibility patterns of those common local pathogens in both the community and hospital must be factored
into the choice of therapy. Potential drug intolerances and toxicity must also be considered.


The most common pathogens that cause septic shock are gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive, and mixed
bacterial microorganisms. Invasive candidiasis, toxic shock syndromes, and an array of uncommon pathogens
should be considered in selected patients. Certain specific conditions put patients at risk for atypical or resistant
pathogens. For example, neutropenic patients are at risk for an especially wide range of potential pathogens,
including resistant gram-negative _bacilli_ and _Candida_ species. Patients with nosocomial acquisition of infection
are prone to sepsis with methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant
_Enterococci_ .


Historically, critically ill patients with overwhelming infection have not been considered a unique subgroup
comparable to neutropenic patients for purposes of selection of antimicrobial therapy. Nonetheless, critically ill
patients with severe and septic shock are, like neutropenic patients, characterized by distinct differences from
the typical infected patient that impact on the optimal antimicrobial management strategy. Primary among
these differences are a predisposition to infection with resistant organisms and a marked increase in frequency
of death and other adverse outcomes if there is a failure of rapid initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy.
Selection of an optimal empiric antimicrobial regimen in sepsis and septic shock is one of the central determinants
of outcome. Survival may decrease as much as fivefold for septic shock treated with an empiric regimen that fails
to cover the offending pathogen (95). Because of the high mortality associated with inappropriate initial therapy,
empiric regimens should err on the side of over-inclusiveness. However, the choice of empiric antimicrobial
regimens in patients with sepsis and septic shock is complex and cannot be reduced to a simple table. Several
factors must be assessed and used in determining the appropriate antimicrobial regimen at each medical centre
and for each patient.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **73**


These include:
a) The anatomic site of infection with respect to the typical pathogen profile and to the properties of individual
antimicrobials to penetrate that site.
b) Prevalent pathogens within the community, hospital, and even hospital ward.
c) The resistance patterns of those prevalent pathogens.
d) The presence of specific immune defects such as neutropenia, splenectomy, poorly controlled HIV infection
and acquired or congenital defects of immunoglobulin, complement or leukocyte function or production.
e) Age and patient comorbidities including chronic illness (e.g., diabetes) and chronic organ dysfunction (e.g.,
liver or renal failure), the presence of invasive devices (e.g., central venous lines or urinary catheter) that
compromise the defence to infection.
In addition, the clinician must assess risk factors for infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens including
prolonged hospital/chronic facility stay, recent antimicrobial use, prior hospitalization, and prior colonization
or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. The occurrence of more severe illness (e.g., septic shock) may
be intrinsically associated with a higher probability of resistant isolates due to selection in failure to respond to
earlier antimicrobials.


Given the range of variables that must be assessed, the recommendation of any specific regimen for sepsis
and septic shock is not possible. The reader is directed to guidelines that provide potential regimens based on
anatomic site of infection or specific immune defects (67,99-109).


However, general suggestions can be provided. Since the vast majority of patients with severe sepsis and septic
shock have one or more forms of immunocompromise, the initial empiric regimen should be broad enough to
cover most pathogens isolated in healthcare-associated infections. Most often, a broad-spectrum carbapenem
(e.g., meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin or doripenem) or extended-range penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor
combination (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam or ticarcillin/clavulanate) is used. However, several third- or highergeneration cephalosporins can also be used, especially as part of a multidrug regimen. Of course, the specific
regimen can and should be modified by the anatomic site of infection if it is apparent and by knowledge of local
microbiologic flora.


Multidrug therapy is often required to ensure a sufficiently broad spectrum of empiric coverage initially.
Clinicians should be cognizant of the risk of resistance to broad-spectrum β-lactams and carbapenems among
gram-negative bacilli in some communities and healthcare settings. The addition of a supplemental gramnegative agent to the empiric regimen is recommended for critically ill septic patients at high risk of infection
with such multidrug-resistant pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, etc.) to increase the probability of
at least one active agent being administered (110). Similarly, in situations of a more-than-trivial risk for other
resistant or atypical pathogens, the addition of a pathogen-specific agent to broaden coverage is warranted.
Vancomycin, teicoplanin, or another anti-MRSA agent can be used when risk factors for MRSA exist. A significant
risk of infection with Legionella species mandates the addition of a macrolide or fluoroquinolone.


Clinicians should also consider whether Candida species are likely pathogens when choosing initial therapy.
Risk factors for invasive Candida infections include immunocompromised status (neutropenia, chemotherapy,
transplant, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver failure, chronic renal failure), prolonged invasive vascular devices
(haemodialysis catheters, central venous catheters), total parenteral nutrition, necrotizing pancreatitis, recent
major surgery (particularly abdominal), prolonged administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged
hospital/ICU admission, recent fungal infection, and multisite colonization (111,112). If the risk of Candida
sepsis is sufficient to justify empiric antifungal therapy, the selection of the specific agent should be tailored
to the severity of illness, the local pattern of the most prevalent Candida species, and any recent exposure to
antifungal drugs. Empiric use of an echinocandin (anidulafungin, micafungin, or caspofungin) is preferred in
most patients with severe illness, especially in those patients with septic shock, who have recently been treated


**74** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



with other antifungal agents, or if Candida glabrata or Candida krusei infection is suspected from earlier culture
data (100,105). Triazoles are acceptable in hemodynamically stable, less ill patients who have not had previous
triazole exposure and are not known to be colonized with azole-resistant species. Liposomal formulations of
amphotericin B are a reasonable alternative to echinocandins in patients with echinocandin intolerance or
toxicity (100,105). Knowledge of local resistance patterns to antifungal agents should guide drug selection
until fungal susceptibility test results, if available, are received. Rapid diagnostic testing using β-D-glucan or
rapid polymerase chain reaction assays to minimize inappropriate anti-Candida therapy may have an evolving
supportive role. However, the negative predictive value of such tests is not high enough to justify dependence
on these tests for primary decision-making.


Superior empiric coverage can be obtained using local and unit-specific antibiograms (113,114) or an infectious
diseases consultation (115-117). Where uncertainty regarding appropriate patient-specific antimicrobial therapy
exists, infectious diseases consultation is warranted. Early involvement of infectious diseases specialists can
improve outcome in some circumstances (e.g. S. aureus bacteraemia) (113-115).


Although restriction of antimicrobials is an important strategy to reduce both the development of pathogen
resistance and cost, it is not an appropriate strategy in the initial therapy for this patient population. Patients
with sepsis or septic shock generally warrant empiric broad-spectrum therapy until the causative organism and
its antimicrobial susceptibilities are defined. At that point, the spectrum of coverage should be narrowed by
eliminating unneeded antimicrobials and replacing broad-spectrum agents with more specific agents (118).
However, if relevant cultures are negative, empiric narrowing of coverage based on a good clinical response
is appropriate. Collaboration with antimicrobial stewardship programs is encouraged to ensure appropriate
choices and rapid availability of effective antimicrobials for treating septic patients.


In situations in which a pathogen is identified, de-escalation to the narrowest effective agent should be
implemented for most serious infections. However, approximately one third of patients with sepsis do not have
a causative pathogen identified (95-119). In some cases, this may be because guidelines do not recommend
obtaining cultures (e.g., community-acquired abdominal sepsis with bowel perforation) (108). In others,
cultures may have followed antimicrobial therapy. Further, almost half of patients with suspected sepsis in one
study have been adjudicated in post hoc analysis to lack infection or represent only “possible” sepsis (120).
Given the adverse societal and individual risks to continued unnecessary antimicrobial therapy, we recommend
thoughtful de-escalation of antimicrobials based on adequate clinical improvement even if cultures are negative.
When infection is found not to be present, antimicrobial therapy should be stopped promptly to minimize the
likelihood that the patient will become infected with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen or develop a drugrelated adverse effect. Thus, the decisions to continue, narrow, or stop antimicrobial therapy must be made on
the basis of clinician judgment and clinical information.


A systemic inflammatory response without infection does not mandate antimicrobial therapy. Examples of
conditions that may exhibit acute inflammatory signs without infection include severe pancreatitis and extensive
burn injury. Sustained systemic antimicrobial therapy in the absence of suspected infection should be avoided in
these situations to minimize the likelihood that the patient will become infected with an antimicrobial-resistant
pathogen or will develop a drug-related adverse effect.


Although the prophylactic use of systemic antimicrobials for severe necrotizing pancreatitis has been
recommended in the past, recent guidelines have favoured avoidance of this approach (121). The current
position is supported by meta-analyses that demonstrate no clinical advantage of prophylactic antibiotics that
would outweigh their long-term adverse effects (122). Similarly, prolonged systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis
has been used in the past for patients with severe burns. However, recent meta-analyses suggest questionable
clinical benefit with this approach (123,124). Current guidelines for burn management do not support sustained
antimicrobial prophylaxis (101). Summarizing the evidence is challenging due to the diversity of the population.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **75**


The quality of evidence was low for mortality in pancreatitis (122) and low for burns; therefore, we believe
this recommendation is better addressed as a BPS, in which the alternative of administering antibiotics
without indicators of infection is implausible (122-124). Despite our recommendation against sustained
systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis generally, brief antibiotic prophylaxis for specific invasive procedures may
be appropriate. In addition, if there is a strong suspicion of concurrent sepsis or septic shock in patients with
a severe inflammatory state of non-infectious origin (despite overlapping clinical presentations), antimicrobial
therapy is indicated.


Early optimization of antimicrobial pharmacokinetics can improve the outcome of patients with severe infection.
Several considerations should be made when determining optimal dosing for critically ill patients with sepsis
and septic shock. These patients have distinct differences from the typical infected patient that affect the
optimal antimicrobial management strategy. These differences include an increased frequency of hepatic and
renal dysfunction, a high prevalence of unrecognized immune dysfunction, and a predisposition to infection
with resistant organisms. Perhaps most importantly with respect to initial empiric antimicrobial dosing is an
increased volume of distribution for most antimicrobials, in part due to the rapid expansion of extracellular
volume as a consequence of aggressive fluid resuscitation. This results in an unexpectedly high frequency of
suboptimal drug levels with a variety of antimicrobials in patients with sepsis and septic shock (125-128). Early
attention to appropriate antimicrobial dosing is central to improving outcome given the marked increase in
mortality and other adverse outcomes if there is a failure of rapid initiation of effective therapy. Antimicrobial
therapy in these patients should always be initiated with a full, high end-loading dose of each agent used.


Different antimicrobials have different required plasma targets for optimal outcomes. Failure to achieve peak
plasma targets on initial dosing has been associated with clinical failure with aminoglycosides (129). Similarly,
inadequate early vancomycin trough plasma concentrations (in relation to pathogen minimum inhibitory
concentration [MIC]) have been associated with clinical failure for serious MRSA infections (130) (including
nosocomial pneumonia (131) and septic shock (132). The clinical success rate for treatment of serious infections
correlates with higher peak blood levels (in relation to pathogen MIC) of fluoroquinolones (nosocomial pneumonia
and other serious infections) (133-135) and aminoglycosides (gram-negative bacteraemia, nosocomial
pneumonia, and other serious infections) (129,136). For β-lactams, superior clinical and microbiologic cures
appear to be associated with a longer duration of plasma concentration above the pathogen MIC, particularly
in critically ill patients (137-140).


The optimal dosing strategy for aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones involves optimizing peak drug plasma
concentrations. For aminoglycosides, this can most easily be attained with once daily dosing (5–7 mg/kg daily
gentamicin equivalent). Once-daily dosing yields at least comparable clinical efficacy with possibly decreased
renal toxicity compared to multiple daily dosing regimens (141,142). Once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides is
used for patients with preserved renal function. Patients with chronically mildly impaired renal function should
still receive a once-daily-equivalent dose but would normally have an extended period (up to 3 days) before
the next dose. This dosing regimen should not be used in patients with severe renal function in whom the
aminoglycoside is not expected to clear within several days. Therapeutic drug monitoring of aminoglycosides in
this context is primarily meant to ensure that trough concentrations are sufficiently low to minimize the potential
for renal toxicity. For fluoroquinolones, an approach that optimizes the dose within a nontoxic range (e.g.,
ciprofloxacin, 600 mg every 12 hours, or levofloxacin, 750 mg every 24 hours, assuming preserved renal function)
should provide the highest probability of a favourable microbiologic and clinical response (127,143,144).


**76** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Vancomycin is another antibiotic whose efficacy is at least partially concentration dependent. Dosing to a trough
target of 15–20 mg/L is recommended by several authorities to maximize the probability of achieving appropriate
pharmacodynamic targets, improve tissue penetration, and optimize clinical outcomes (145-147). Pre-dose
monitoring of trough concentrations is recommended. For sepsis and septic shock, an IV loading dose of 25–30 mg/
kg (based on actual body weight) is suggested to rapidly achieve the target trough drug concentration. A loading
dose of 1 gram of vancomycin will fail to achieve early therapeutic levels for a significant subset of patients. In fact,
loading doses of antimicrobials with low volumes of distribution (teicoplanin, vancomycin, colistin) are warranted
in critically ill patients to more rapidly achieve therapeutic drug levels due to their expanded extracellular volume
related to volume expansion following fluid resuscitation (148-152). Loading doses are also recommended for
β-lactams administered as continuous or extended infusions to accelerate accumulation of drug to therapeutic
levels (153). Notably, the required loading dose of any antimicrobial is not affected by alterations of renal function,
although this may affect frequency of administration and/or total daily dose.


For β-lactams, the key pharmacodynamics correlate to microbiologic and clinical response is the time that
the plasma concentration of the drug is above the pathogen MIC relative to the dosing interval (T > MIC). A
minimum T > MIC of 60% is generally sufficient to allow a good clinical response in mild to moderate illness.
However, optimal response in severe infections, including sepsis, may be achieved with a T > MIC of 100% (139).
The simplest way to increase T > MIC is to use increased frequency of dosing (given an identical total daily dose).
For example, piperacillin/tazobactam can be dosed at either 4.5 g every 8 hours or 3.375 g every 6 hours for
serious infections; all things being equal, the latter would achieve a higher T > MIC. We suggested earlier that
initial doses of β-lactams can be given as a bolus or rapid infusion to rapidly achieve therapeutic blood levels.
However, following the initial dose, an extended infusion of drug over several hours (which increases T > MIC)
rather than the standard 30 minutes has been recommended by some authorities (154,155). In addition, some
meta-analyses suggest that extended/continuous infusion of β-lactams may be more effective than intermittent
rapid infusion, particularly for relatively resistant organisms and in critically ill patients with sepsis (140, 156158). A recent individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing continuous
versus intermittent infusion of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients with severe sepsis demonstrated an
independent protective effect of continuous therapy after adjustment for other correlates of outcome (140).


While the weight of evidence supports pharmacokinetically optimized antimicrobial dosing strategies in critically
ill patients with sepsis and septic shock, this is difficult to achieve on an individual level without a broader
range of rapid therapeutic drug monitoring options than currently available (i.e., vancomycin, teicoplanin and
aminoglycosides). The target group of critically ill, septic patients exhibit a variety of physiologic perturbations
that dramatically alter antimicrobial pharmacokinetics. These include unstable hemodynamic, increased cardiac
output, increased extracellular volume (markedly increasing volume of distribution), variable kidney and hepatic
perfusion (affecting drug clearance) and altered drug binding due to reduced serum albumin (159). In addition,
augmented renal clearance is a recently described phenomenon that may lead to decreased serum antimicrobial
levels in the early phase of sepsis (160-162). These factors make individual assessment of optimal drug dosing
difficult in critically ill patients. Based on studies with therapeutic drug monitoring, under-dosing (particularly in
the early phase of treatment) is common in critically ill, septic patients, but drug toxicity such as central nervous
system irritation with β-lactams and renal injury with colistin is also seen (163-166). These problems mandate
efforts to expand access to therapeutic drug monitoring for multiple antimicrobials for critically ill patients with
sepsis.


In light of the increasing frequency of pathogen resistance to antimicrobial agents in many parts of the world,
the initial use of multidrug therapy is often required to ensure an appropriately broad-spectrum range of
coverage for initial empiric treatment. The use of multidrug therapy for this purpose in severe infections is well
understood.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **77**


The phrase “combination therapy” in the context of this guideline connotes the use of two different classes
of antibiotics (usually a β-lactam with a fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, or macrolide) for a single putative
pathogen expected to be sensitive to both, particularly for purposes of accelerating pathogen clearance. The
term is not used where the purpose of a multidrug strategy is to strictly broaden the range of antimicrobial
activity (e.g., vancomycin added to ceftazidime, metronidazole added to an aminoglycoside or an echinocandin
added to a β-lactam).


A propensity-matched analysis and a meta-analysis/meta-regression analysis have demonstrated that
combination therapy produces higher survival in severely ill septic patients with a high risk of death, particularly
in those with septic shock (167,168). A meta-regression study (167) suggested benefit with combination therapy
in patients with a mortality risk greater than 25%. Several observational studies have similarly shown a survival
benefit in very ill patients (169-172). However, the aforementioned meta-regression analysis also suggested
the possibility of increased mortality risk with combination therapy in low-risk (< 15% mortality risk) patients
without septic shock (167). One controlled trial suggested that, when using a carbapenem as empiric therapy in
a population at low risk for infection with resistant microorganisms, the addition of a fluoroquinolone does not
improve patients’ outcomes (173). A close examination of the results, however, demonstrates findings consistent
with the previously mentioned meta-regression (trend to benefit in septic shock with an absence of benefit in
sepsis without shock). Despite the overall favourable evidence for combination therapy in septic shock, direct
evidence from adequately powered RCTs is not available to validate this approach definitively. Nonetheless,
in clinical scenarios of severe clinical illness (particularly septic shock), several days of combination therapy
is biologically plausible and is likely to be clinically useful (152,167,168) even if evidence has not definitively
demonstrated improved clinical outcome in bacteraemia and sepsis without shock (174,175). Thus, we issue a
weak recommendation based on low quality of evidence.


A number of other recent observational studies and some small, prospective trials also support initial combination
therapy for selected patients with specific pathogens (e.g., severe pneumococcal infection, multidrug-resistant
gram-negative pathogens) (172,176-182). Unfortunately, in most cases and pending the development of rapid
bedside pathogen detection techniques, the offending pathogen is not known at the time of presentation.
Therefore, specifying combination therapy to specific identified pathogens is useful only if more prolonged,
targeted combination therapy is contemplated. In addition, with respect to multidrug-resistant pathogens, both
individual studies and meta-analyses yield variable results depending on the pathogen and the clinical scenario
(179–184). Infectious diseases consultation may be advisable if multidrug-resistant pathogens are suspected.
One area of broad consensus on the use of a specific form of combination therapy is for streptococcal toxic shock
syndrome, for which animal models and uncontrolled, clinical experience demonstrate a survival advantage
with penicillin and clindamycin, the latter as a transcriptional inhibitor to pyrogenic exotoxin superantigens
(109,185,186).


Despite evidence suggesting benefit of combination therapy in septic shock, this approach has not been shown
to be effective for ongoing treatment of most other serious infections, including bacteraemia and sepsis without
shock (168,174,175). The term “ongoing treatment” includes extended empiric therapy for culture-negative
infections and extended definitive/targeted therapy where a pathogen is identified. In the case of neutropenia
in the absence of septic shock, studies using modern broad-spectrum antibiotics consistently suggest that,
while multidrug therapy to broaden pathogen coverage (e.g., to include Candida species) may be useful,
combination therapy using a β-lactam and an aminoglycoside for purposes of accelerating pathogen clearance
is not beneficial for less severely ill “low-risk” patients (187). Combination therapy of this sort for even “highrisk” neutropenic patients (inclusive of hemodynamic instability and organ failure) with sepsis is inconsistently
supported by several international expert groups (106,188). This position against combination therapy for a
single pathogen in any form of neutropenic infection emphatically does not preclude the use of multidrug
therapy for the purpose of broadening the spectrum of antimicrobial treatment.


**78** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



High-quality data on clinically driven de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy for severe infections are limited
(189). Early de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy in the context of combination therapy as described here has
not been studied. However, observational studies have shown that early de-escalation of multidrug therapy is
associated with equivalent or superior clinical outcomes in sepsis and septic shock (54,190-192); despite this,
at least one study has indicated an increased frequency of superinfection and longer ICU stay (192). In addition
to institutional benefit with respect to limiting a driver of antimicrobial resistance, early de-escalation can also
benefit the individual patient (193-195). Although the data are not entirely consistent, on balance, an approach
that emphasizes early de-escalation is favoured when using combination therapy.


While substantial consensus on the need for early de-escalation of combination therapy exists, agreement
is lacking on precise criteria for triggering de-escalation. Among approaches used by panel members are
de-escalation based on: a) clinical progress (shock resolution, decrease in vasopressor requirement, etc.), b)
infection resolution as indicated by biomarkers (especially procalcitonin), and c) a relatively fixed duration of
combination therapy. This lack of consensus on de-escalation criteria for combination therapy reflects the lack
of solid data addressing this issue (notwithstanding procalcitonin data relating to general de-escalation).


Unnecessarily prolonged administration of antimicrobials is detrimental to society and to the individual patient.
For society, excessive antimicrobial use drives antimicrobial resistance development and dissemination (196).
For individual patients, prolonged antibiotic therapy is associated with specific illnesses such as Clostridium
difficile colitis (195) and, more broadly, an increased mortality risk (54). The basis of the increased mortality with
unnecessarily prolonged and broad antimicrobial therapy has not been convincingly demonstrated, although
cumulative antimicrobial toxicity; the occurrence of antimicrobial-associated secondary infections (e.g., C difficile
colitis); and selection of, and superinfection with, multidrug-resistant pathogens are all potential contributors.


Although patient factors will influence the length of antibiotic therapy, a treatment duration of 7 to 10 days (in
the absence of source control issues) is generally adequate for most serious infections (103,197-199). Current
guidelines recommend a 7-day course of therapy for nosocomial pneumonia (both hospital-acquired and
ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]) (103). Recent data suggest that some serious infections may be treated
with shorter courses especially if there is a need for and successful provision of source control (200,201).
Subgroup analysis of the most critically ill subjects (Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE]
II score greater than either 15 or 20) in the short course of antimicrobials in the intra-abdominal sepsis study
of Sawyer et al (demonstrated no difference in outcome based on the duration of therapy (as with the overall
group) (200,202). A treatment duration of 3 to 5 days or fewer was as effective as a duration of up to 10
days. Similarly, studies have shown that a treatment duration of < 7 days is as effective as longer durations in
the management of acute pyelonephritis with or without bacteraemia (201), uncomplicated cellulitis (203),
and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (204). Some conditions are generally thought to require more prolonged
antimicrobial therapy. These include situations in which there is a slow clinical response, undrainable foci of
infection, bacteraemia with S aureus (particularly MRSA) (67,104), candidemia/invasive candidiasis (105) and
other fungal infections, some viral infections (e.g., herpes, cytomegalovirus), and immunologic deficiencies,
including neutropenia (188).


Assessment of the required duration of therapy in critically ill patients should include host factors, particularly
immune status. For example, patients with neutropenic infection and sepsis usually require therapy for at
least the duration of their neutropenia. The nature of the infecting pathogen also plays a role. In particular,
uncomplicated S aureus bacteraemia requires at least 14 days of therapy, while complicated bacteraemia
requires treatment as an endovascular infection with 6 weeks of therapy. Uncomplicated bacteraemia has been
defined as: 1) exclusion of endocarditis, 2) no implanted prostheses, 3) negative results of follow-up blood
cultures drawn 2 to 4 days after the initial set, 4) defervescence within 72 hours after the initiation of effective
antibiotic therapy, and 5) no evidence of metastatic infection (104). Patients with candidemia (whether or
not catheter-associated) and deep Candida infections, whether or not associated with sepsis, require more


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **79**


prolonged therapy (105,205). Highly resistant gram-negative pathogens with marginal sensitivity to utilized
antimicrobials may be slow to clear and represent another example. The nature and site of infection may also
affect duration of therapy. Larger abscesses and osteomyelitis have limited drug penetration and require longer
therapy. Although it is well known that endocarditis requires prolonged antimicrobial therapy, severe disease
more typically presents as cardiac failure/cardiogenic shock and emboli rather than as sepsis or septic shock
(206,207). A variety of other factors may play a role in determining the optimal duration of therapy, particularly
in critically ill infected patients. If the clinician is uncertain, infectious diseases consultation should be sought.
Few of the studies noted focused on patients with septic shock, sepsis with organ failure, or even critical illness.
To an extent, standard recommendations on duration of therapy in this document depend on inferences from
less ill cohorts. Therefore, decisions to narrow or stop antimicrobial therapy must ultimately be made on the
basis of sound clinical judgment


There are many reasons for unnecessarily prolonged antimicrobial therapy. For complicated, critically ill patients
admitted with serious infections, non-infectious concurrent illness and medical interventions may produce signs
and symptoms consistent with active infection (even following control of infection). For example, pulmonary
infiltrates and shortness of breath may be caused by pulmonary oedema in addition to pneumonia; an elevated
white cell count may occur as a consequence of corticosteroid administration or physiologic stress; fever may be
associated with certain drugs, including β-lactams and phenytoin. In addition, there is a natural tendency to want
to continue a therapy that is often seen as benign long enough to be confident of cure. However, as discussed,
antimicrobials are not an entirely benign therapy. In low-risk patients, the adverse effects can outweigh any benefit.


Given the potential harm associated with unnecessarily prolonged antimicrobial therapy, daily assessment for
de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy is recommended in patients with sepsis and septic shock. Studies have
shown that daily prompting on the question of antimicrobial de-escalation is effective and may be associated
with improved mortality rates (55,208).


During the past decade, the role of biomarkers to assist in the diagnosis and management of infections has been
extensively explored. The use of galactomannan and β-D-glucan to assist in the assessment of invasive aspergillus
(and a broad range of fungal pathogens) has become well accepted (209,210). Similarly, measurement of serum
procalcitonin is commonly used in many parts of the world to assist in the diagnosis of acute infection and to
help define the duration of antimicrobial therapy. Various procalcitonin-based algorithms have been used to
direct de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy in severe infections and sepsis (211-216). However, it is not clear
that any particular algorithm provides a clinical advantage over another. A large body of literature suggests that
use of such algorithms can speed safe antimicrobial de-escalation compared to standard clinical approaches
with reduced antimicrobial consumption without an adverse effect on mortality. Recently, a large randomized
trial on procalcitonin use in critically ill patients with presumed bacterial infection demonstrated evidence of a
reduction in duration of treatment and daily defined doses of antimicrobials (217). However, given the design
of the study, the reduction could have been related to a prompting effect as seen in other studies (55,218). In
addition, the procalcitonin group showed a significant reduction in mortality. This finding is congruent with
studies demonstrating an association between early antimicrobial de-escalation and survival in observational
studies of sepsis and septic shock (54,55). This benefit is uncertain, though, because another meta-analysis of
randomized controlled studies of de-escalation failed to demonstrate a similar survival advantage (219). Metaanalyses also suggest that procalcitonin can also be used to assist in differentiating infectious and non-infectious
conditions at presentation (211,214,216). The strongest evidence appears to relate to bacterial pneumonia
versus non-infectious pulmonary pathology (216,220), where meta-analysis suggests that procalcitonin may
assist in predicting the presence of bacteraemia, particularly in ICU patients (221).


No evidence to date demonstrates that the use of procalcitonin reduces the risk of antibiotic-related diarrhoea
from C difficile. However, the occurrence of C difficile colitis is known to be associated with cumulative antibiotic
exposure in individual patients (195), so such a benefit is likely. In addition, although prevalence of antimicrobial
resistance has not been shown to be reduced by the use of procalcitonin, the emergence of antimicrobial
resistance is known to be associated with total antimicrobial consumption in large regions (196).

| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



It is important to note that procalcitonin and all other biomarkers can provide only supportive and supplemental
data to clinical assessment. Decisions on initiating, altering, or discontinuing antimicrobial therapy should never
be made solely on the basis of changes in any biomarker, including procalcitonin.


Sterilization of cultures can occur within minutes to hours after the first dose of an appropriate antimicrobial (49,
50). Obtaining cultures prior to the administration of antimicrobials significantly increases the yield of cultures,
making identification of a pathogen more likely. Isolation of an infecting organism(s) allows for de-escalation of
antimicrobial therapy first at the point of identification and then again when susceptibilities are obtained. Deescalation of antimicrobial therapy is a mainstay of antibiotic stewardship programs and is associated with less
resistant microorganisms, fewer side effects, and lower costs (51). Several retrospective studies have suggested
that obtaining cultures prior to antimicrobial therapy is associated with improved outcome (52, 53). Similarly, deescalation has also been associated with improved survival in several observational studies (54, 55). The desire to
obtain cultures prior to initiating antimicrobial therapy must be balanced against the mortality risk of delaying a
key therapy in critically ill patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock who are at significant risk of death (56, 57).


We recommend that blood cultures be obtained prior to initiating antimicrobial therapy if cultures can be
obtained in a timely manner. However, the risk/benefit ratio favours rapid administration of antimicrobials if
it is not logistically possible to obtain cultures promptly. Therefore, in patients with suspected sepsis or septic
shock, appropriate routine microbiologic cultures should be obtained before initiation of antimicrobial therapy
from all sites considered to be potential sources of infection if it results in no substantial delay in the start of
antimicrobials. This may include blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, wounds, respiratory secretions, and other
body fluids, but does not normally include samples that require an invasive procedure such as bronchoscopy or
open surgery. The decision regarding which sites to culture requires careful consideration from the treatment
team. “Pan culture” of all sites that could potentially be cultured should be discouraged (unless the source of
sepsis is not clinically apparent), because this practice can lead to inappropriate antimicrobial use (58). If history
or clinical examination clearly indicates a specific anatomic site of infection, cultures of other sites (apart from
blood) are generally unnecessary. We suggest 45 minutes as an example of what may be considered to be no
substantial delay in the initiation of antimicrobial therapy while cultures are being obtained.
Two or more sets (aerobic and anaerobic) of blood cultures are recommended before initiation of any new
antimicrobial in all patients with suspected sepsis (59). All necessary blood cultures may be drawn together on
the same occasion. Blood culture yield has not been shown to be improved with sequential draws or timing to
temperature spikes (60, 61). Details on appropriate methods to draw and transport blood culture samples are
enumerated in other guidelines (61, 62).


In potentially septic patients with an intravascular catheter (in place > 48 hours) in whom a site of infection is not
clinically apparent or a suspicion of intravascular catheter-associated infection exists, at least one blood culture
set should be obtained from the catheter (along with simultaneous peripheral blood cultures). This is done to
assist in the diagnosis of a potential catheter-related bloodstream infection. Data are inconsistent regarding the
utility of differential time to blood culture positivity (i.e., equivalent volume blood culture from the vascular
access device positive more than 2 hours before the peripheral blood culture) in suggesting that the vascular
access device is the source of the infection (63–65). It is important to note that drawing blood cultures from an
intravascular catheter in case of possible infection of the device does not eliminate the option of removing the
catheter (particular non-tunnelled catheters) immediately afterward.


In patients without a suspicion of catheter-associated infection and in whom another clinical infection site is
suspected, at least one blood culture (of the two or more that are required) should be obtained peripherally.

However, no recommendation can be made as to where additional blood cultures should be drawn. Options
include a) all cultures drawn peripherally via venepuncture, b) cultures drawn through each separate intravascular
device but not through multiple lumens of the same intravascular catheter, or c) cultures drawn through multiple
lumens in an intravascular device (66–70).


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **81**


In the near future, molecular diagnostic methods may offer the potential to diagnose infections more quickly
and more accurately than current techniques. However, varying technologies have been described, clinical
experience remains limited, and additional validation is needed before recommending these methods as an
adjunct to or replacement for standard blood culture techniques (71–73). In addition, susceptibility testing is
likely to require isolation and direct testing of viable pathogens for the foreseeable future.

**Antimicrobial Stewardship**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



**Implementation Point 9 (Recommendations 16, 16A (new) & 17)**
Managing sepsis in the era of increasing rates of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO) should be linked
tightly with antimicrobial stewardship (DOH, 2017a) (HPSC, 2009). Coupled with rising rates of MDRO, few new
antimicrobials are being developed, therefore, prescribing antimicrobials appropriately is essential for both
patient safety (to minimise adverse effects) and for future generations (so effective antimicrobials are available
to manage infection and sepsis). It is recommended that the ‘Start Smart and then Focus’ (Appendix 15),
approach is employed for antimicrobial therapy (RCPI, 2012). Where more than one antimicrobial alternative
exists, their relative costs should also be considered whilst adhering to local antimicrobial guidelines.
Further information on MDRO’s can be found on the Health Protection Surveillance centre website at the
following link htps://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/microbiologyantmicrobialresistance/


**Start Smart**

Intravenous antimicrobials are administered as part of the Sepsis 6 bundle within one hour of diagnosis of
infection in patients screened to be at high risk of mortality from sepsis. (See Section A; Screening).
All acute hospitals have guidelines for the empiric use of antimicrobials in adults that are appropriate for the
local MDRO epidemiology. It is recommended that these guidelines be used to choose empiric therapy for
patients with infection, taking the following into consideration:


1. **Source of the infection**

   - Community acquired

   - Healthcare associated

   - Hospital acquired

2. **Site of the infection**

Based on the history and the examination of the patient e.g. respiratory, abdominal, genito-urinary,
device or catheter-related, cellulitis, central nervous system, bone or joint or unknown.

3. **Patient considerations**

Patient factors that need to be taken into consideration and may influence the choice of empiric
antimicrobial therapy include:

   - Group B Streptococcus

   - Group A Streptococcus (associated high mortality in maternity) (Steven and Bryant, 2019)

   - Previous infection or colonisation with MDRO such as meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), extended-spectrum B-lactamase (ESBL) producing/gram negative organism etc.

   - Recent antimicrobial therapy

   - Current outbreaks

   - Recent infections in close contacts

   - Recent travel or hospitalization and/or residence in another country

   - Allergy status.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **85**


Penicillin allergy is frequently reported and if inaccurate may compromise patient care. Getting a clear description
of the reported reaction to penicillin distinguishes between allergy and side-effect and more accurately describes
an allergic response. The majority (90%-99%) of patients with a reported penicillin allergy do not have immediate
hypersensitivity and approximately 1% of patients with an allergy to penicillin will also react to cephalosporins
(45). Thus a patient, who develops a rash in response to penicillin, may be considered low risk for treatment
with a cephalosporin, but someone with angio-oedema or cardiovascular collapse at higher high risk.


**Implementation Point 10 (Recommendation 18)**
Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be prescribed at the optimal dose, frequency and duration, based on
individual patient characteristics (e.g. age, weight, renal function), likely causative organism, site of infection, and
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the antimicrobial agent(s). For certain antimicrobials
(e.g., aminoglycosides), it is essential that serum for therapeutic drug monitoring is measured appropriately,
and the results acted upon in a timely manner. Local antimicrobial guidelines include recommendations on
dosing, weight calculation and intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) switch and they should be consulted to ensure dose
optimisation.


**Implementation Point 11 (Recommendation 19)**
The two-drug combination for septic shock is based on the likely source of the infection, rising MDRO rates
and the fact that in some instances the source of infection may not be apparent. In guidelines that use the
terminology of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, use the guidance for severe sepsis for patients with acute
organ dysfunction due to infection irrespective of the terminology used and the guidance for septic shock for
patients on vasopressors/ inotropes due to acute infection.


**Implementation Point 12 (Recommendations 20 & 21)**
**NB.** Local guidelines should be taken into account when considering combination antimicrobial therapy for
sepsis. The choice of single or combination agents may vary depending on local MDRO epidemiology.


**Start smart roles and responsibilities (Implementation points 9-12) :**
It is the responsibility of each acute hospital to have local antimicrobial guidelines that are readily available
to clinicians at all times. These guidelines should be under the governance of the antimicrobial stewardship
committee (HPSC, 2009). A clinical microbiologist or infectious disease specialist should be available for
consultation on complex cases at a Consultant to Consultant level. It is the responsibility of treating clinicians to
be familiar with accessing the local guideline and with its use in guiding empiric therapy.


**Then focus**

**Implementation Point 13 (Recommendations 22 & 23)**
Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be rationalized on the basis of ongoing clinical review and results
of laboratory investigations and diagnostic imaging, as outlined in the Start Smart Then Focus care bundle
(RCPI, 2012). All empiric antimicrobial therapy should be reviewed on a daily basis by the clinician responsible
for the patient’s care. To ensure continuity of care and in light of changing work practices in hospitals, it is
recommended that all antimicrobial prescriptions have a documented review date and indication for the
prescription to facilitate safe handover of patient care. It is recommended that local antimicrobial prescribing
guidelines are consulted for the criteria for converting parenteral antimicrobial therapy to oral therapy once the
patient’s condition allows.


**86** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



**Implementation Point 14 (Recommendations 26, 27, 28, 29 & 30)**
An essential component of antimicrobial stewardship is restricting antimicrobial prescription durations to the
minimum duration required for clinical efficacy. As recommended previously in this NCG, all antimicrobial
prescriptions should have the proposed duration documented and should be reviewed on a daily basis.
Procalcitonin is a serum biomarker that is useful in distinguishing bacterial infection from other causes of
infection or inflammation and may be useful in guiding duration of antimicrobial therapy (Rogić et al., 2017).
Most data is from patients with lower respiratory infection in the critical care setting (Sager et al., 2017). In
addition, procalcitonin does not replace clinical judgment and provides only supportive and supplemental data
to clinical assessment (Huang et al., 2018). There are a number of limitations with procalcitonin as a stewardship
tool, including suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity, which makes a careful interpretation in the clinical
context essential. In addition, they are not available widely and knowledge regarding their use is evolving.


**Implementation Point 15 (Recommendation 24 & 25)**
When a patient presents unwell or deteriorates, a list of potential diagnoses is formed, based on history and
examination, and tests and investigations are ordered to help confirm the diagnosis. Sepsis screening recommends
the Sepsis 6 bundle/Sepsis 6 +1 be administered to patients with a clinical suspicion of infection who are in one
of the three high-risk groups. If a non-infectious diagnosis is identified, and there is no reasonable suspicion of
a concurrent infection, antimicrobial therapy should be stopped.


**Then focus: Roles and responsibilities (Implementation points, 13-15)**
It is the responsibility of the treating team, or its delegate, to review the patient daily and to assess the
antimicrobial therapy in terms of the patients’ clinical response and laboratory results during the acute phase
of the illness and to decide on and document the duration of treatment appropriate to the illness.


**Implementation Point 16 (Recommendations 15)**
Blood cultures are taken as part of the Sepsis 6 bundle prior to antimicrobial administration. This will maximize
the yield of positive cultures, which can then be used to guide appropriate antimicrobial management, with
reduced use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy and associated complications due to multi-drug resistant
organisms and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Blood cultures should always be taken using an aseptic (nontouch) technique. Care should be taken to prevent contamination when obtaining cultures as this may lead
to the initiation of unnecessary antimicrobial therapy and investigations, potential adverse events, as well as
lengthening hospital stays and costs. The acceptable rate for contamination rates is < 3% (Snyder et al., 2012). It
is recommended that units regularly audit their contamination rates and review their practices accordingly. Prepacked blood culture sets and strategies to ensure aseptic technique have been shown to reduce contamination
rates (Bentley et al., 2016). Practical considerations have to be taken into account, for example, if a unit has the
practice that the blood cultures are drawn from the intravenous cannula, then that cannula must be inserted
with aseptic technique and the blood culture be taken as the first draw and the culture bottle immediately
inoculated. When possible, it is recommended that blood cultures be taken via a separate puncture.


Other specimens for culture will be based on the clinical history and examination and will target the suspected
site of infection. This includes cultures being taken through potential infected central lines. If source is being
controlled it is recommended that specimens (e.g. pus, joint fluid) be sent for microbiological assessment, this
should not lead to a delay in administering antimicrobials in patients with sepsis and septic shock.


**Roles and responsibilities (Implementation point 16):**
Administering the Sepsis 6 bundle/Sepsis 6 +1 correctly and in a timely fashion requires multi-disciplinary
cooperation and processes to be put in place to facilitate achieving this goal. Components of the bundle can be
performed by different team members depending on their training and experience and the policies of different
institutions. Local policies should be developed to facilitate this, in the best interest of the patient. Resources
such as “Sepsis Trolleys”, or similar, with all the components required for Sepsis 6/Sepsis 6+1 delivery and “blood
culture packs” may facilitate timely and appropriate care.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **87**


It is the responsibility of the treating doctor to complete and sign off on the sepsis form. In the event of a
handover occurring mid-treatment, a verbal handover of care and outstanding tasks should be given, and the
handover section of the sepsis form filled. It is then the responsibility of the receiving doctor to complete and
sign off the form.
It is the responsibility of hospital management to ensure that sepsis forms are available along with the necessary
components of the Sepsis 6 bundle, in a time-accessible way, so that this intervention can be completed.
It is the responsibility of the treating team, or its delegate, to review the patient daily and to assess the
antimicrobial therapy in terms of the patients’ clinical response and laboratory results during the acute phase
of the illness and to decide on and document the duration of treatment appropriate to the illness.


**3.1.4 Source Control**

**Key question**

 - In patients with sepsis or septic shock, should we attempt early (within 12 hours) source control?


**SSCG Rationale**


The principles of source control in the management of sepsis and septic shock include rapid diagnosis of the
specific site of infection and determination of whether that infection site is amenable to source control measures
(specifically the drainage of an abscess, debridement of infected necrotic tissue, removal of a potentially infected
device, and definitive control of a source of ongoing microbial contamination) (222). Foci of infection readily
amenable to source control include intra-abdominal abscesses, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic bowel or
volvulus, cholangitis, cholecystitis, pyelonephritis associated with obstruction or abscess, necrotizing soft tissue
infection, other deep space infection (e.g., empyema or septic arthritis), and implanted device infections.


Infectious foci suspected to cause septic shock should be controlled as soon as possible following successful
initial resuscitation (223,224). A target of no more than 6 to 12 hours after diagnosis appears to be sufficient for
most cases (223-229). Observational studies generally show reduced survival beyond that point. The failure to
show benefit with even earlier source control implementation may be a consequence of the limited number of
patients in these studies. Therefore, any required source control intervention in sepsis and septic shock should
ideally be implemented as soon as medically and logistically practical after the diagnosis is made.


Clinical experience suggests that, without adequate source control, some more severe presentations will not
stabilize or improve despite rapid resuscitation and provision of appropriate antimicrobials. In view of this fact,
prolonged efforts at medical stabilization prior to source control for severely ill patients, particularly those with
septic shock, are generally not warranted (108).


The selection of optimal source control methods must weigh the benefits and risks of the specific intervention,
risks of transfer for the procedure, potential delays associated with a specific procedure, and the probability of
the procedure’s success. Source control interventions may cause further complications, such as bleeding, fistulas,
or inadvertent organ injury. In general, the least invasive effective option for source control should be pursued.
Open surgical intervention should be considered when other interventional approaches are inadequate or
cannot be provided in a timely fashion. Surgical exploration may also be indicated when diagnostic uncertainty
persists despite radiologic evaluation or when the probability of success with a percutaneous procedure is
uncertain and the mortality risk as a consequence of a failed procedure causing delays is high. Specific clinical
situations require consideration of available choices, the patient’s preferences, and the clinician’s expertise.
Logistic factors unique to each institution, such as surgical or interventional staff availability, may also play a role
in the decision.


**88** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Intravascular devices such as central venous catheters can be the source of sepsis or septic shock. An intravascular
device suspected to be a source of sepsis should generally be removed promptly after establishing another site
for vascular access. In the absence of both septic shock and fungemia, some implanted, tunnelled catheter
infections may be able to be treated effectively with prolonged antimicrobial therapy if removal of the catheter
is not practical (67). However, catheter removal (with antimicrobial therapy) is definitive and is preferred where
possible.


**Recommendation 31.** (SSCG Section E, Recommendation 1).
We recommend that a specific anatomic diagnosis of infection requiring emergent source control be
identified or excluded as rapidly as possible in patients with sepsis or septic shock, and that any required
source control intervention be implemented as soon as medically and logistically practical after the
diagnosis is made.
**Quality/level of evidence: Low        + Strength of recommendation: BPS**

**Recommendation 32.** (SSCG Section E, Recommendation 2).
We recommend prompt removal of intravascular access devices that are a possible source of sepsis or
septic shock after other vascular access has been established.
**Quality/level of evidence: Low      + Strength of recommendation: BPS**


**Implementation Point 17 (Recommendation 31 & 32)**
To achieve compliance with these recommendations a number of steps need to occur:
1. Identification of the need for source control
2. Early consultation with appropriate surgical team
3. Access to diagnostics
4. Feasibility of achieving source control
5. Identifying the best method available
6. Access to interventional radiology/ surgery


Infected collections and devitalised tissues cannot be effectively managed by antimicrobials alone and thus
need to be drained or debrided. In patients with sepsis and/or septic shock antimicrobials should not be delayed
more than 1 hour from differential diagnosis (Time Zero) to facilitate microbiological sampling of the collection.
Patients with suspicion of an infectious collection but with no evidence of acute organ dysfunction or shock
should be managed according to usual pathways and monitored for deterioration. If deterioration occurs, as
evidenced by a new INEWS score ≥ 4, the development of acute organ dysfunction or exercising professional
judgment, the Sepsis 6 bundle should be administered, and source control achieved as soon as practicable but
ideally within 12 hours of deterioration.


Patients whose infection is not settling on appropriate antimicrobials need to be re-assessed for source control
including reviewing implanted devices and catheters as potential sources. If such devices are potential sources,
they should be removed or treated where possible and sent for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.


 - Early consultation with an appropriate surgical team is extremely important. Definitive source control,
where appropriate, should be performed at the first available opportunity. Logistic and scheduling issues
that might delay surgery may be reduced when the likely need for surgical intervention can be planned as
far ahead as possible.

 - While less invasive techniques (such as radiologically guided drainage) may be more appropriate, this
decision should be made in a multidisciplinary setting with an appropriate surgical opinion obtained
before intervention. Inappropriate radiological drainage may delay adequate source control.

 - Appropriate access to an emergency operating theatre is required to ensure safe care for patients


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **89**


 - In certain circumstances (rarely), particularly where patients are very unstable or have specific supports
in place that preclude transfer, some surgical procedures may be performed in the ICU. Appropriate
equipment (lighting etc) and standard operating procedures should be developed in advance to ensure
timely treatment is not delayed.
**Maternity only**
If the need for source control involves evacuation of the uterus, it is recommended that this be performed as
soon as practicable following usual communication and procedural pathways. Inform consultant obstetrician,
anaesthetist, clinical microbiologist and as applicable, neonatologist.


**Roles and responsibilities (Implementation Point 17):**

It is the responsibility of the treating clinician to assess and refer for source control as indicated. It is the
responsibility of the effector of source control (surgery, interventional radiology, other) to take into consideration
the severity of illness and the time of presentation when organizing the time for source control which should be
done as soon as practical.


It is the responsibility of the hospital management to ensure sufficient resources are in place to enable clinicians
to achieve source control in a timely manner.


**3.1.5 Vasoactive medications**

**Key questions**

 - In patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors, should we use norepinephrine versus other agents?

 - In patients with septic shock not responding to single vasopressors, should we add epinephrine?

 - In patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors, should we use norepinephrine alone versus combination
with vasopressin?

 - In patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors, should we use of vasopressin versus other agents?

 - In patients with septic shock requiring vasopressors, should we use dopamine versus other agents?

 - In patients with septic shock and persistent hypoperfusion, should we use alternative inotropic agents to
increase cardiac output?


**SSCG Rationale**


The physiologic effects of vasopressors and combined inotrope/vasopressor selection in septic shock are
outlined in an extensive number of literature reviews (252-261). Norepinephrine increases MAP due to its
vasoconstrictive effects, with little change in heart rate and less increase in stroke volume compared with
dopamine. Dopamine increases MAP and cardiac output, primarily due to an increase in stroke volume and
heart rate. Norepinephrine is more potent than dopamine and may be more effective at reversing hypotension
in patients with septic shock. Dopamine may be particularly useful in patients with compromised systolic
function but causes more tachycardia and may be more arrhythmogenic than norepinephrine (262). It may also
influence the endocrine response via the hypothalamic pituitary axis and may have immunosuppressive effects
(263). However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis that included 11 randomized trials (n =1,710)
comparing norepinephrine to dopamine does not support the routine use of dopamine in the management of
septic shock (264). Indeed, norepinephrine use resulted in lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98, highquality evidence) and lower risk of arrhythmias (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58; high-quality evidence) compared
with dopamine (Supplemental Digital Content 8, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C329).

Human and animal studies suggest that the infusion of epinephrine may have deleterious effects on the splanchnic
circulation and produces hyperlactatemia. However, clinical trials do not demonstrate worsening of clinical
outcomes. One RCT comparing norepinephrine to epinephrine demonstrated no difference in mortality but an
increase in adverse drug-related events with epinephrine (265). Similarly, a meta-analysis of four randomized
trials (n = 540) comparing norepinephrine to epinephrine found no significant difference in mortality (RR, 0.96;
CI, 0.77−1.21; low-quality evidence) (Supplemental Digital Content 9, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C330) (254).
Epinephrine may increase aerobic lactate production via stimulation of skeletal muscle β2-adrenergic receptors
and thus may preclude the use of lactate clearance to guide resuscitation.


Vasopressin levels in septic shock have been reported to be lower than anticipated for a shock state (266). Low
doses of vasopressin may be effective in raising blood pressure in patients refractory to other vasopressors
and may have other potential physiologic benefits (266-271). Terlipressin has similar effects but is longacting (272). Studies show that vasopressin concentrations are elevated in early septic shock but decrease to
normal range in most patients between 24 and 48 hours as shock continues (273). This finding has been called
relative vasopressin deficiency because, in the presence of hypotension, vasopressin would be expected to
be elevated. The significance of this finding is unknown. The VASST trial, an RCT comparing norepinephrine
alone to norepinephrine plus vasopressin at 0.03 U/min, showed no difference in outcome in the intent-totreat population (274). An a priori defined subgroup analysis demonstrated improved survival among patients
receiving <15 μg/min norepinephrine at randomization with the addition of vasopressin; however, the pretrial
rationale for this stratification was based on exploring potential benefit in the population requiring ≥ 15 μg/min
norepinephrine. Higher doses of vasopressin have been associated with cardiac, digital, and splanchnic ischemia
and should be reserved for situations in which alternative vasopressors have failed (275). In the VANISH trial,
409 patients with septic shock were randomized in a factorial (2 × 2) design to receive vasopressin with placebo
or hydrocortisone, or norepinephrine with placebo or hydrocortisone. There was no significant difference in
kidney failure-free days or death; however, the vasopressin group had less use of RRT (276). We conducted
an updated meta-analysis to include the results of the VANISH trial. Data from nine trials (n = 1,324 patients
with septic shock), comparing norepinephrine with vasopressin (or terlipressin) demonstrated no significant
difference in mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79–1.00; moderate-quality evidence) (Supplemental Digital Content
10, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C331) (268,271,272,277-279). Results were similar after excluding trials that used
a combination of norepinephrine and vasopressin in the intervention arm (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77–1.02). Large
studies comparing vasopressin to other vasopressors in septic shock are lacking; most of the data regarding
vasopressin support a sparing effect on norepinephrine dose, and there is uncertainty about the effect of
vasopressin on mortality. Norepinephrine, therefore, remains the first-choice vasopressor to treat patients with
septic shock. We do not recommend the use of vasopressin as a first-line vasopressor for the support of MAP
and would advocate caution when using it in patients who are not euvolemic or at doses higher than 0.03 U/min.


Phenylephrine is a pure α-adrenergic agonist. Clinical trial data in sepsis are limited. Phenylephrine has the
potential to produce splanchnic vasoconstriction (280). A network meta-analysis resulted in imprecise estimates
(wide confidence intervals) when phenylephrine was compared to other vasopressors (281). Therefore, the
impact on clinical outcomes is uncertain, and phenylephrine use should be limited until more research is available.


A large, randomized trial and meta-analysis comparing low-dose dopamine to placebo found no difference in
need for RRT, urine output, time to renal recovery, survival, ICU stay, hospital stay, or arrhythmias (282,283). Thus,
the available data do not support administration of low doses of dopamine solely to maintain renal function.


Myocardial dysfunction consequent to infection occurs in a subset of patients with septic shock, but cardiac
output is usually preserved by ventricular dilation, tachycardia, and reduced vascular resistance (284). Some
portion of these patients may have diminished cardiac reserve and may not be able to achieve a cardiac
output adequate to support oxygen delivery. Recognition of such reduced cardiac reserve can be challenging;
imaging studies that show decreased ejection fraction may not necessarily indicate inadequate cardiac output.
Concomitant measurement of cardiac output along with a measure of the adequacy of perfusion is preferable.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **91**


Routinely increasing cardiac output to predetermined “supranormal” levels in all patients clearly does not
improve outcomes, as shown by two large prospective clinical trials of critically ill ICU patients with sepsis
treated with dobutamine (285-287). Some patients, however, may have improved tissue perfusion with
inotropic therapy aimed at increasing oxygen delivery. In this situation, dobutamine is the first-choice inotrope
for patients with measured or suspected low cardiac output in the presence of adequate left ventricular filling
pressure (or clinical assessment of adequate fluid resuscitation) and adequate MAP. Monitoring the response
of indices of perfusion to measured increases in cardiac output is the best way to target such a therapy (287).


The data supporting dobutamine are primarily physiologic, with improved haemodynamics and some
improvement in indices of perfusion, which may include clinical improvement, decreasing lactate levels, and
improvement in ScvO2. No randomized controlled trials have compared the effects of dobutamine versus
placebo on clinical outcomes. Mortality in patients randomized to dobutamine added to norepinephrine was
no different compared to epinephrine (287), although the trial may have been underpowered. Dobutamine was
used as the first-line inotrope as part of standard care in clinical trials of EGDT (16,19,288,289), and adverse
effects on mortality were not detected with its use.


Although there are only a few studies, alternative inotropic agents might be used to increase cardiac output
in specific situations. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors increase intracellular cyclic AMP and thus have inotropic
effects independent of β-adrenergic receptors. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone was shown to
increase cardiac output in one small, randomized trial of 12 paediatric patients, but the trial was underpowered
for assessment of outcomes (290). Levosimendan increases cardiac myocyte calcium responsiveness and opens
ATP-dependent potassium channels, giving the drug both inotropic and vasodilatory properties. Given the
potential role for abnormal calcium handling in sepsis-induced myocardial depression, the use of levosimendan
has been proposed in septic shock as well. In a trial of 35 patients with septic shock and acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) randomized to levosimendan or placebo, levosimendan improved right ventricular
performance and mixed venous oxygen saturation compared to placebo (291). Trials comparing levosimendan
with dobutamine are limited but show no clear advantage for levosimendan (292). Levosimendan is more
expensive than dobutamine and is not available in many parts of the world. Six small RCTs (116 patients in
total) compared levosimendan to dobutamine; pooled estimates showed no significant effect on mortality (RR,
0.83; 95% CI, 0.66–1.05; low quality) (Supplemental Digital Content 11, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C332). Given
the low-quality evidence available and the higher cost associated with levosimendan, dobutamine remains the
preferred choice in this population. An RCT enrolled 516 patients with septic shock who were randomized to
receive either levosimendan or placebo; there was no difference in mortality. However, levosimendan led to
significantly higher risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia than placebo (absolute difference, 2.7%; 95% CI,
0.1%–5.3%) (293). The results of this trial question the systematic use of this agent in patients with septic shock.
Of note, cardiac function was not evaluated in that trial, and inotropic stimulation may be of benefit in patients
with a low cardiac output due to impaired cardiac function.


In shock states, estimation of blood pressure using a cuff, especially an automated measurement system, may
be inaccurate. Use of an arterial cannula provides a more accurate and reproducible measurement of arterial
pressure (287,294) and allows beat-to-beat analysis so that decisions regarding therapy can be based on
immediate and reproducible blood pressure information (295). Insertion of radial arterial catheters is generally
safe; a systematic review of observational studies showed an incidence of limb ischemia and bleeding to be
less than 1%, with the most common complication being localized hematoma (14%) (296). Complication rates
may be lower if an ultrasound-guided technique is used (297). A recent systematic review showed higher risk
of infections when femoral arterial catheters were used compared to radial artery catheters (RR, 1.93; 95% CI,
1.32–2.84), and the overall pooled incidence of bloodstream infection was 3.4 per 1,000 catheters (298). Large
randomized trials that compare arterial blood pressure monitoring versus non-invasive methods are lacking.


In view of the low complication rate and likely better estimation of blood pressure but potentially limited
resources in some countries, and the lack of high-quality studies, the benefits of arterial catheters probably
outweigh the risks. Therefore, we issued a weak recommendation in favour of arterial catheter placement.


**92** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Arterial catheters should be removed as soon as continuous hemodynamic monitoring is not required to
minimize the risk of complications.


**Recommendation 33.** (SSCG Section G, Recommendation 1).
We recommend norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor.
**Quality/level of evidence: Moderate       + Strength of recommendation: Strong**

**Recommendation 34.** (SSCG Section G, Recommendation 2).
We suggest adding either vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min) (weak recommendation, moderate quality of
evidence) or epinephrine (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence) to norepinephrine with the
intent of raising MAP to target or adding vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min).
**Quality/level of evidence: Moderate       + Strength of recommendation: Weak**

**Recommendation 35.** (SSCG Section G, Recommendation 3).
We suggest using dopamine as an alternative vasopressor agent to norepinephrine only in highly selected
patients (e.g. patients with low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative bradycardia).
**Quality/level of evidence: Low             + Strength of recommendation: Weak**


**Recommendation 36.** (SSCG Section G, Recommendation 4).
We **recommend against** using low-dose dopamine for renal protection.
**Quality/level of evidence: High            + Strength of recommendation: Strong**


**Recommendation 37.** (SSCG Section G, Recommendation 5).
We suggest using dobutamine in patients who show evidence of persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate
fluid loading and the use of vasopressor agents.
**Quality/level of evidence: Low             + Strength of recommendation: Weak**

_**Remarks:**_ _If initiated, vasopressor dosing should be titrated to an end point reflecting perfusion, and the_
_agent reduced or discontinued in the face of worsening hypotension or arrhythmias_


**Recommendation 38.** (SSCG Section G, Recommendation 6).
We suggest that all patients requiring vasopressors have an arterial catheter placed as soon as practical if
resources are available.
**Quality/level of evidence: Very low        + Strength of recommendation: Weak**


**Recommendation 38a.** (SSCG 2021, Recommendation 44).
We suggest starting vasopressors peripherally to restore mean arterial pressure rather than delaying
initiation until central venous access is secured for patients with septic shock. **See Appendix 17 (in this**
**document) and refer to local guidelines [new 2025].**

**Quality/level of evidence: Low        + Strength of recommendation: Weak [new 2025]**


**Implementation Point 18 (Recommendations 33-38a)**
Patients who present with profound shock may require simultaneous pressor/inotrope and fluid administration.
The end point of resuscitation is to restore flow rather than pressure, however, available monitors measure
pressure rather than flow so surrogates are used which assess organ and tissue perfusion. These include
urinary output, point of care lactate (venous or arterial), capillary refill, mental status and central venous
oxygen saturations.


Persistently high serum lactates and central venous oxygen saturations despite adequate fluid resuscitation may
represent established cellular dysfunction and an inability to extract or utilise oxygen rather than hypoperfusion
due to sepsis or other causes (Andersen et al., 2013) and as such will not respond to further fluid administration.
Lactate physiology is complex and should be used only as one of a number of markers of tissue perfusion.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **93**


The suggested approach to resuscitation is early aggressive fluid resuscitation aiming to restore tissue perfusion
and then a conservative post resuscitation phase avoiding excessive fluid accumulation with careful monitoring
of input and output and assessing for de-resuscitation by diuresis/fluid removal as soon as tolerated using
perfusion parameters (Levy et al., 2018) (Yealy et al., 2014) (Mouncey et al., 2015) (Peake, 2014) (Wiedemann,
2006) (Hjortrup et al., 2016).


**Roles and responsibilities (Implementation point 18)**
Vasopressors and inotropes are most usually prescribed by critical care staff and unless familiar with them,
it is prudent to obtain critical care support when starting them. Phenylephrine is not the first line pressor for
septic shock (Rhodes et al., 2017). Noradrenaline is the first line agent. It has both α and β receptor effects,
so it maintains cardiac output as well as having a vasoconstrictor effect. Phenylephrine, if used urgently as a
temporary pressor, should be replaced by noradrenaline as soon as possible.


Starting vasopressors requires multidisciplinary support for central venous access, constitution and delivery of
the vasopressors and aseptic technique.


It is the responsibility of hospital management to ensure the appropriate equipment and staff is available to
provide this service.


It is the responsibility of the clinicians to be familiar with the procedures and to know the advantages and
limitations of any advanced haemodynamic monitoring equipment deployed.


It is the responsibility of the hospital and laboratory management to ensure that all point of care equipment is
subjected to laboratory governance and including internal quality control and external quality assurance.


**3.1.6 Corticosteroids**

**Key question**

 - In patients with septic shock, should we use intravenous corticosteroids (versus not)?


**SSCG Rationale**


The response of septic shock patients to fluid and vasopressor therapy seems to be an important factor in
selection of patients for optional hydrocortisone therapy. One French multicentre RCT of patients in vasopressorunresponsive septic shock (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressors for
more than one hour) showed significant shock reversal and reduction of mortality rate in patients with relative
adrenal insufficiency (defined as a maximal post-adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] cortisol increase ≤ 9 μg/
dL) (299). Two smaller RCTs also showed significant effects on shock reversal with steroid therapy (300,301).
In contrast, a large, European multicentre trial (CORTICUS) that enrolled patients with systolic blood pressure
of < 90 mm Hg despite adequate fluid replacement or need for vasopressors had a lower risk of death than
the French trial and failed to show a mortality benefit with steroid therapy (302). There was no difference in
mortality in groups stratified by ACTH response.


Several systematic reviews have examined the use of low-dose hydrocortisone in septic shock with contradictory
results. Annane et al (299) analysed the results of 12 studies and calculated a significant reduction in 28-day
mortality with prolonged low-dose steroid treatment in adult septic shock patients (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72−0.97;
p = 0.02). In parallel, Sligl et al (303) used a similar technique, but identified only eight studies for their metaanalysis, six of which had a high-level RCT design with low risk of bias. In contrast to the aforementioned review,
this analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in mortality (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.84−1.18).


**94** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Both reviews, however, confirmed the improved shock reversal by using low-dose hydrocortisone. More
recently, Annane et al included 33 eligible trials (n = 4,268) in a new systematic review (304). Of these 33 trials,
23 were at low risk of selection bias; 22 were at low risk of performance and detection bias; 27 were at low
risk of attrition bias; and 14 were at low risk of selective reporting. Corticosteroids reduced 28-day mortality
(27 trials; n = 3,176; RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76–1.00). Treatment with a long course of low-dose corticosteroids
significantly reduced 28-day mortality (22 trials; RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.97). Corticosteroids also reduced ICU
mortality (13 trials; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–1.00) and in hospital mortality (17 trials; RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.98).
Corticosteroids increased the proportion of shock reversal by day 7 (12 trials; RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14–1.51) and
by day 28 (7 trials; n = 1,013; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02–1.21). Finally, an additional systematic review by Volbeda
et al including a total of 35 trials randomizing 4,682 patients has been published (all but two trials had high risk
of bias) (305). Conversely, in this review, no statistically significant effect on mortality was found for any dose
of steroids versus placebo or for no intervention at maximal follow-up. The two trials with low risk of bias also
showed no statistically significant difference (random-effects model RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.06–2.42). Similar results
were obtained in subgroups of trials stratified according to hydrocortisone (or equivalent) at high (> 500 mg)
or low (≤ 500 mg) doses (RR, 0.87; trial sequential analysis [TSA]-adjusted CI; 0.38–1.99; and RR, 0.90; TSAadjusted CI, 0.49–1.67, respectively). No statistically significant effects on serious adverse events other than
mortality were reported (RR, 1.02; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.7–1.48). In the absence of convincing evidence of benefit,
we issue a weak recommendation against the use of corticosteroids to treat septic shock patients if adequate
fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability.


In one study, the observation of a potential interaction between steroid use and ACTH test was not statistically
significant (306). Furthermore, no evidence of this distinction was observed between responders and nonresponders in a recent multicentre trial (302). Random cortisol levels may still be useful for absolute adrenal
insufficiency; however, for septic shock patients who have relative adrenal insufficiency (no adequate stress
response), random cortisol levels have not been demonstrated to be useful. Cortisol immunoassays may over or
underestimate the actual cortisol level, affecting the assignment of patients to responders or non-responders
(307). Although the clinical significance is not clear, it is now recognized that etomidate, when used for induction
for intubation, will suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (308,309). Moreover, a sub analysis of the
CORTICUS trial revealed that the use of etomidate before application of low-dose steroids was associated with
an increased 28-day mortality rate (302).


There has been no comparative study between a fixed-duration and clinically guided regimen or between tapering
and abrupt cessation of steroids. Three RCTs used a fixed-duration protocol for treatment (300,302,306), and
therapy was decreased after shock resolution in two RCTs (301,310)). In four studies, steroids were tapered
over several days (300-302, 310) and steroids were withdrawn abruptly in two RCTs (306,311). One crossover
study showed hemodynamic and immunologic rebound effects after abrupt cessation of corticosteroids (312).
Further, one study revealed no difference in outcome of septic shock patients if low-dose hydrocortisone is used
for 3 or 7 days; hence, we suggest tapering steroids when vasopressors are no longer needed (313).
Steroids may be indicated when there is a history of steroid therapy or adrenal dysfunction, but whether lowdose steroids have a preventive potency in reducing the incidence of sepsis and septic shock in critically ill
patients cannot be answered. A recent large multicentre RCT demonstrated no reduction in the development
of septic shock in septic patients treated with hydrocortisone versus placebo (314); steroids should not be
used in septic patients to prevent septic shock. Additional studies are underway that may provide additional
information to inform clinical practice.


Several randomized trials on the use of low-dose hydrocortisone in septic shock patients revealed a significant
increase of hyperglycaemia and hypernatremia (306) as side effects. A small prospective study demonstrated
that repetitive bolus application of hydrocortisone leads to a significant increase in blood glucose; this peak
effect was not detectable during continuous infusion. Further, considerable inter-individual variability was seen
in this blood glucose peak after the hydrocortisone bolus (315). Although an association of hyperglycaemia
and hypernatremia with patient outcome measures could not be shown, good practice includes strategies for
avoidance and/or detection of these side effects.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **95**


**Recommendation 39.** (SSCG Section H, Recommendation 1).
We **suggest against** using IV hydrocortisone to treat septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation
and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability. If this is not achievable, we suggest IV
hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg per day (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).
**Quality/level of evidence: Low** **+ Strength of recommendation: Weak**


**Implementation Point 19 (Recommendation 39)**
Patients with fluid resistant, pressor-resistant shock should have a trial of IV hydrocortisone 50mg qds or by
continuous infusion, consider adding fludrocortisone 50 micrograms once daily orally or via nasogastric tube
(Annane, 2011) (Keh et al., 2016).
Do not routinely give systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of sepsis without shock outside of clinical trials
unless they are indicated for other reasons.


**Roles and Responsibilities**
It is the responsibility of the clinicians to be familiar with the procedures and to know the advantages and
limitations of corticosteroids in the treatment of septic shock.


**3.1.7 Blood Products**

**Key questions**

 - In patients with sepsis, should we use a restrictive transfusion strategy versus liberal transfusion?

 - In patients with sepsis and anemia, should we use erythropoietin to treat anemia?

 - In non-bleeding patients with sepsis and coagulation abnormalities, should we use prophylactic FFP?

 - In non-bleeding patients with sepsis and thrombocytopenia, should we use prophylactic platelet transfusion
based on specific platelet levels?


**SSCG Rationale**


Two clinical trials in septic patients evaluated specific blood transfusion thresholds. The Transfusion Requirements
In Septic Shock (TRISS) trial addressed a transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL versus 9 g/dL in septic shock patients after
admission to the ICU (316). Results showed similar 90-day mortality, ischemic events, and use of life support in
the two treatment groups with fewer transfusions in the lower-threshold group. The haemoglobin targets in two
of the three treatment arms in the Protocol-Based Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) trial were a subpart of
a more comprehensive sepsis management strategy (18). The EGDT group received transfusion at a haematocrit
< 30% (haemoglobin 10 g/dL) when the ScvO2 was < 70% after initial resuscitation interventions compared
to the protocol-based standard care group that received blood transfusion only when the haemoglobin was
< 7.5 g/dL. No significant differences were found between the two groups for 60-day in-hospital mortality or
90-day mortality. Although the ProCESS trial is a less direct assessment of blood transfusion therapy, it does
provide important information in regard to transfusion in the acute resuscitative phase of sepsis. We judge the
evidence to be high certainty that there is little difference in mortality, and, if there is, that it would favour lower
haemoglobin thresholds.


No specific information regarding erythropoietin use in septic patients is available, and clinical trials of
erythropoietin administration in critically ill patients show a small decrease in red cell transfusion requirement
with no effect on mortality (317,318). The effect of erythropoietin in sepsis and septic shock would not be
expected to be more beneficial than in other critical conditions. Erythropoietin administration may be associated
with an increased incidence of thrombotic events in the critically ill.


**96** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Patients with sepsis and septic shock may have coexisting conditions that meet indications for the use of
erythropoietin or similar agents.


No RCTs exist related to prophylactic fresh frozen plasma transfusion in septic or critically ill patients with
coagulation abnormalities. Current recommendations are based primarily on expert opinion that fresh frozen
plasma be transfused when there is a documented deficiency of coagulation factors (increased prothrombin
time, international normalized ratio, or partial thromboplastin time) and the presence of active bleeding or
before surgical or invasive procedures (319). In addition, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma usually fails to correct
the prothrombin time in nonbleeding patients with mild abnormalities. No studies suggest that correction of
more severe coagulation abnormalities benefits patients who are not bleeding.


No RCTs of prophylactic platelet transfusion in septic or critically ill patients exist. Current recommendations and
guidelines for platelet transfusion are based on clinical trials of prophylactic platelet transfusion in patients with
therapy-induced thrombocytopenia (usually leukaemia and stem cell transplant) (320-327). Thrombocytopenia
in sepsis is likely due to a different pathophysiology of impaired platelet production and increased platelet
consumption. Factors that may increase the bleeding risk and indicate the need for a higher platelet count are
frequently present in patients with sepsis.


**Recommendation 40.** (SSCG Section I, Recommendation 1).
We recommend that Red Blood Cell (RBC) transfusion occur only when hemoglobin concentration
decreases to < 7.0g/dL in adults in the absence of extenuating circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia,
severe hypoxemia, or acute hemorrhage.
**Quality/level of evidence: High             + Strength of recommendation: Strong**

**Recommendation 41.** (SSCG Section I, Recommendation 2).
We **recommend against** the use of erythropoietin for treatment of anemia associated with sepsis.
**Quality/level of evidence: Moderate        + Strength of recommendation: Strong**

**Recommendation 42.** (SSCG Section I, Recommendation 3).
We **suggest against** the use of fresh frozen plasma* to correct clotting abnormalities in the absence of
bleeding or planned invasive procedures.
_*Known as frozen plasma in Ireland and often by a tradename._
**Quality/level of evidence: Very low        + Strength of recommendation: Weak**

**Recommendation 43.** (SSCG Section I, Recommendation 4).
We suggest prophylactic platelet transfusion when counts are < 10 × 109/L (10,000/mm3) in the absence
of apparent bleeding and when counts are < 20 × 109/L (20,000/mm3) if the patient has a significant risk
of bleeding. Higher platelet counts ≥ 50 × 109/L (50,000/mm3) are advised for active bleeding, surgery, or
invasive procedures
**Quality/level of evidence: Very low        + Strength of recommendation: Weak**


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **97**


**3.1.8 Immunoglobulins**


**Key question**

 - In adult patients with sepsis or septic shock, should we use intravenous immunoglobulins (versus not)?


**SSCG Rationale**


There were no new studies informing this guideline recommendation. One larger multicentre RCT (n = 624)
(328) in adult patients found no benefit for IV immunoglobulin (IVIg). The most recent Cochrane meta-analysis
(329) differentiates between standard polyclonal IV immunoglobulins (IVIgG) and immunoglobulin M-enriched
polyclonal Ig (IVIgGM). In 10 studies with IVIgG (1,430 patients), mortality between 28 and 180 days was 29.6%
in the IVIgG group and 36.5 % in the placebo-group (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.93), and for the seven studies
with IVIgGM (528 patients), mortality between 28 and 60 days was 24.7% in the IVIgGM group and 37.5% in
the placebo-group (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51–0.85). The certainty of the studies was rated as low for the IVIgG
trials, based on risk of bias and heterogeneity, and as moderate for the IVIgGM trials, based on risk of bias.
Comparable results were found in other meta-analyses (330). However, after excluding low-quality trials, the
recent Cochrane analysis (329) revealed no survival benefit.


These findings are in accordance with those of two older meta-analyses (331,332) from other Cochrane authors.
One systematic review (332) included a total of 21 trials and showed a reduction in death with immunoglobulin
treatment (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68−0.88); however, the results of only high-quality trials (total of 763 patients)
did not show a statistically significant difference (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.84−1.24). Similarly, Laupland et al. (331)
found a significant reduction in mortality with the use of IVIg treatment (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53−0.83; p < 0.005).
When only high-quality studies were pooled, the results were no longer statistically significant (OR, 0.96); OR
for mortality was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.71−1.3; p = 0.78). Two meta-analyses that used less strict criteria to identify
sources of bias or did not state their criteria for the assessment of study quality found significant improvement
in patient mortality with IVIg treatment (333-335). Finally, there are no cut-offs for plasma IgG levels in septic
patients, for which substitution with IVIgG improves outcome data (334).


Most IVIg studies are small, and some have a high risk of bias; the only large study (n = 624) showed no effect
(328). Subgroup effects between IgM-enriched and non-enriched formulations reveal significant heterogeneity.
Indirectness and publication bias were considered, but not invoked in grading this recommendation. The low
certainty of evidence led to the grading as a weak recommendation. The statistical information that comes from
the high-quality trials does not support a beneficial effect of polyclonal IVIg. We encourage conduct of large
multicentre studies to further evaluate the effectiveness of other IV polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations in
patients with sepsis.


**Recommendation 44.** (SSCG Section J, Recommendation 1).

**3.1.9 Blood purification**


**Key questions**

 - In patients with sepsis, should we use plasma filtration therapy?

 - In patients with sepsis, should we use a hemoperfusion therapy?


**98** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**


**SSCG Rationale**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Blood purification includes various techniques, such as high-volume hemofiltration and hemadsorption (or
hemoperfusion), where sorbents, removing either endotoxin or cytokines, are placed in contact with blood;
plasma exchange or plasma filtration, through which plasma is separated from whole blood, removed, and
replaced with normal saline, albumin, or fresh frozen plasma; and the hybrid system: coupled plasma filtration
adsorption (CPFA), which combines plasma filtration and adsorption by a resin cartridge that removes cytokines.
When these modalities of blood purification are considered versus conventional treatment, the available trials
are, overall, small, unblinded, and with high risk of bias. Patient selection was unclear and differed with the
various techniques. Hemadsorption is the technique most largely investigated, in particular with polymyxin
B-immobilized polystyrene-derived fibres to remove endotoxin from the blood. A recent meta-analysis
demonstrated a favourable effect on overall mortality with this technique (336). The composite effect, however,
depends on a series of studies performed in a single country (Japan), predominantly by one group of investigators.
A recent large RCT performed on patients with peritonitis related to organ perforation within 12 hours after
emergency surgery found no benefit of polymyxin B hemoperfusion on mortality and organ failure, as compared
to standard treatment (337). Illness severity of the study patients, however, was low overall, which makes these
findings questionable. A multicentre blinded RCT is ongoing, which should provide stronger evidence regarding
this technique (338).


Few RCTs evaluated plasma filtration, alone or combined with adsorption for cytokine removal (CPFA). A
recent RCT comparing CPFA with standard treatment was stopped for futility (339). About half of the patients
randomized to CPFA were undertreated, primarily because of clotting of the circuit, which raises doubts about
CPFA feasibility.


In consideration of all these limitations, our confidence in the evidence is very low either in favour of or against
blood purification techniques; therefore, we do not provide a recommendation. Further research is needed to
clarify the clinical benefit of blood purification techniques.


**Recommendation 45.** (SSCG Section K, Recommendation 1).
We make no recommendation regarding the use of blood purification techniques.
**Quality/level of evidence: N/A        + Strength of recommendation: N/A**


**3.1.10 Anticoagulants**


**Key question**

 - In adult patients with sepsis or septic shock, should we use antithrombin (versus not)?


**SSCG Rationale**


Antithrombin is the most abundant anticoagulant circulating in plasma. The decrease of its plasma activity at
onset of sepsis correlates with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and lethal outcome. However, a
phase III clinical trial of high dose antithrombin for adults with sepsis and septic shock as well as systematic
reviews of antithrombin for critically ill patients did not demonstrate any beneficial effect on overall mortality.
Antithrombin was associated with an increased risk of bleeding (340,341). Although post hoc subgroup analyses
of patients with sepsis associated with DIC showed better survival in patients receiving antithrombin, this agent
cannot be recommended until further clinical trials are performed.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **99**


Most RCTs of recombinant soluble thrombomodulin have been targeted for sepsis associated with DIC, and a
systematic review suggested a beneficial effect on survival without an increase of bleeding risk (342,343). A phase
III RCT is ongoing for sepsis associated with DIC. The guideline panel has elected to make no recommendation
pending these new results. Two systematic reviews showed a potential survival benefit of heparin in patients
with sepsis without an increase in major bleeding (344). However, overall impact remains uncertain, and heparin
cannot be recommended until further RCTs are performed.
Recombinant activated protein C, which was originally recommended in the 2004 and 2008 SSC guidelines, was
not shown to be effective for adult patients with septic shock by the PROWESS-SHOCK trial and was withdrawn
from the market (345).


**Recommendation 46.** (SSCG Section L, Recommendation 1).
We recommend against the use of antithrombin for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock
**Quality/level of evidence: Moderate       + Strength of recommendation: Strong**

**Recommendation 47.** (SSCG Section L, Recommendation 2).
We make no recommendation regarding the use of thrombomodulin or heparin for the treatment of sepsis
or septic shock.
**Quality/level of evidence: N/A             + Strength of recommendation: N/A**


**3.1.11 Mechanical Ventilation**


**Key questions**

 - In patients with sepsis induced ARDS, should we use low tidal volume ventilation?

 - In patients with sepsis induced ARDS who are mechanically ventilated, should we use plateau pressures less
than 30 cm H2O?

 - In patients with sepsis induced ARDS who are mechanically ventilated, should we use high PEEP strategy?

 - In patients with sepsis induced ARDS, should we use recruitment manoeuvres?

 - In patients with sepsis induced severe ARDS, should we use prone ventilation?

 - In patients with sepsis who are mechanically ventilated, should we elevate the head of the bed?

 - In patients with sepsis induced ARDS, should we use non-invasive ventilation?

 - In patients with sepsis who are mechanically ventilated and ready for weaning, should we use weaning
protocol versus physician guided weaning?

 - In patients with sepsis who are mechanically ventilated and ready for weaning, should we use spontaneous
breathing trials (SBT)?

 - In patients with sepsis induced ARDS, should we use a Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC)?

 - In patients with sepsis induced ARDS, should we use a conservative fluid strategy?

 - In patients with sepsis induced ARDS, should we use inhaled Beta agonists?

 - In patients with sepsis induced ARDS, should we use ECMO treatment?

 - In patients with sepsis induced ARDS, should we use High Frequency Oscillation (HFO) versus conventional
ventilation?

 - In patients with sepsis induced respiratory failure without ARDS, should we use low tidal volume ventilation?

 - In patients with severe ARDS who are mechanically ventilated, should we use neuromuscular blocking
agents?

This recommendation is unchanged from the previous guidelines. Of note, the studies that guide the
recommendations in this section enrolled patients using criteria from the American-European Consensus Criteria
Definition for Acute Lung Injury and ARDS (346). For the current document, we used the 2012 Berlin definition
and the terms mild, moderate, and severe ARDS (PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 300, ≤ 200, and ≤ 100 mm Hg, respectively) (347).
Several multicentre randomized trials have been performed in patients with established ARDS to evaluate the
effects of limiting inspiratory pressure through moderation of tidal volume (348-351). These studies showed
differing results, which may have been caused by differences in airway pressures in the treatment and control
groups (347,350,352). Several meta-analyses suggest decreased mortality in patients with a pressure- and
volume-limited strategy for established ARDS (353,354).


The largest trial of a volume- and pressure-limited strategy showed 9% absolute decrease in mortality in ARDS
patients ventilated with tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg compared with 12 mL/kg PBW and aiming for plateau pressure
≤ 30 cm H2O (350). The use of lung-protective strategies for patients with ARDS is supported by clinical trials and
has been widely accepted; however, the precise tidal volume for an individual ARDS patient requires adjustment
for factors such as the plateau pressure, the selected positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), thoracoabdominal
compliance, and the patient’s breathing effort. Patients with profound metabolic acidosis, high minute
ventilation, or short stature may require additional manipulation of tidal volumes. Some clinicians believe it
may be safe to ventilate with tidal volumes > 6 mL/kg PBW as long as plateau pressure can be maintained ≤
30 cm H2O (355),356). The validity of this ceiling value will depend on the patient’s effort because those who
are actively breathing generate higher transpulmonary pressures for a given plateau pressure than patients
who are passively inflated. Conversely, patients with very stiff chest/abdominal walls and high pleural pressures
may tolerate plateau pressures > 30 cm H2O because transpulmonary pressures will be lower. A retrospective
study suggested that tidal volumes should be lowered even with plateau pressures ≤ 30 cm H2O (357) because
lower plateau pressures were associated with reduced hospital mortality (358). A recent patient-level mediation
analysis suggested that a tidal volume that results in a driving pressure (plateau pressure minus set PEEP) below
12–15 cm H2O may be advantageous in patients without spontaneous breathing efforts (359). Prospective
validation of tidal volume titration by driving pressure is needed before this approach can be recommended.
High tidal volumes coupled with high plateau pressures should be avoided in ARDS. Clinicians should use as a
starting point the objective of reducing tidal volume over 1 to 2 hours from its initial value toward the goal of a
“low” tidal volume (≈6 mL/kg PBW) achieved in conjunction with an end-inspiratory plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm
H2O. If plateau pressure remains > 30 cm H2O after reduction of tidal volume to 6 mL/kg PBW, tidal volume may
be further reduced to as low as 4 mL/kg PBW. Respiratory rate should be increased to a maximum of 35 breaths/
minute during tidal volume reduction to maintain minute ventilation. Volume- and pressure-limited ventilation
may lead to hypercapnia even with these maximum tolerated set respiratory rates; this appears to be tolerated
and safe in the absence of contraindications (e.g., high intracranial pressure, sickle cell crisis).


No single mode of ventilation (pressure control, volume control) has consistently been shown to be advantageous
when compared with any other that respects the same principles of lung protection.


Raising PEEP in ARDS may open lung units to participate in gas exchange. This may increase PaO2 when PEEP
is applied through either an endotracheal tube or a face mask (360-362). In animal experiments, avoidance
of end-expiratory alveolar collapse helps minimize ventilator-induced lung injury when relatively high plateau
pressures are in use. Three large multicentre trials and a pilot trial using higher versus lower levels of PEEP
in conjunction with low tidal volumes did not show benefit or harm (363-366). A patient-level meta-analysis
showed no benefit in all patients with ARDS; however, patients with moderate or severe ARDS (PaO2/FIO2 ≤
200 mm Hg) had decreased mortality with the use of higher PEEP, whereas those with mild ARDS did not (367).
A patient-level analysis of two of the randomized PEEP trials suggested a survival benefit if PaO2/FIO2 increased
with higher PEEP and harm if PaO2/FIO2 fell (368). A small, randomized trial suggested that adjusting PEEP to


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **101**


obtain a positive transpulmonary pressure as estimated by oesophageal manometry improved outcomes; a
confirmatory trial is underway (369). An analysis of nearly all the randomized trials of lung-protective ventilation
suggested a benefit of higher PEEP if driving pressure fell with increased PEEP, presumably indicating increased
lung compliance from opening of lung units (359).


While moderate-quality evidence suggests that higher PEEP improves outcomes in moderate to severe ARDS,
the optimal method for selecting a higher PEEP level is unclear. One option is to titrate PEEP according to
bedside measurements of thoracopulmonary compliance with the objective of obtaining the best compliance
or lowest driving pressure, reflecting a favourable balance of lung recruitment and overdistension (370). The
second option is to titrate PEEP upward on a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW until the plateau airway pressure is
28 cm H2O (365). A third option is to use a PEEP/FIO2 titration table that titrates PEEP based on the combination
of FIO2 and PEEP required to maintain adequate oxygenation (350, 363-365,368). A PEEP > 5 cm H2O is usually
required to avoid lung collapse (371).


Many strategies exist for treating refractory hypoxemia in patients with severe ARDS (372). Temporarily raising
transpulmonary pressure may facilitate opening atelectatic alveoli to permit gas exchange (371), but could
also over distend aerated lung units, leading to ventilator-induced lung injury and transient hypotension. The
application of sustained continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) appears to improve survival (RR, 0.84; 95%
CI, 0.74–0.95) and reduce the occurrence of severe hypoxia requiring rescue therapy (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.41–
1.40) in patients with ARDS. Although the effects of recruitment manoeuvres improve oxygenation initially,
the effects can be transient (373). Selected patients with severe hypoxemia may benefit from recruitment
manoeuvres in conjunction with higher levels of PEEP, but little evidence supports the routine use in all ARDS
patients (373). Any patient receiving this therapy should be monitored closely and recruitment manoeuvres
discontinued if deterioration in clinical variables is observed.


In patients with ARDS and a PaO2/FIO2 ratio < 150, the use of prone compared with supine position within
the first 36 hours of intubation, when performed for > 16 hours a day, showed improved survival (374). Metaanalysis including this study demonstrated reduced mortality in patients treated with prone compared with
supine position (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71–1.01) as well as improved oxygenation as measured by change in
PaO2/FIO2 ratio (median 24.03 higher, 95% CI, 13.3–34.7 higher) (375). Most patients respond to the prone
position with improved oxygenation and may also have improved lung compliance (374,376-379). While prone
position may be associated with potentially life-threatening complications including accidental removal of the
endotracheal tube, this was not evident in pooled analysis (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.85–1.39). However, prone position
was associated with an increase in pressure sores (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05–1.79) (375), and some patients have
contraindications to the prone position (374).


In patients with refractory hypoxia, alternative strategies, including airway pressure release ventilation and
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, may be considered as rescue therapies in experienced centres (372,
380-383).


HFOV has theoretical advantages that make it an attractive ventilator mode for patients with ARDS. Two large
RCTs evaluating routine HFOV in moderate-severe ARDS have been recently published (384,385). One trial was
stopped early because the mortality was higher in patients randomized to HFOV (384). Including these recent
studies, a total of five RCTs (1,580 patients) have examined the role of HFOV in ARDS. Pooled analysis demonstrates
no effect on mortality (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83–1.31) and an increased duration of mechanical ventilation (MD, 1.1
days higher; 95% CI, 0.03–2.16) in patients randomized to HFOV. An increase in barotrauma was seen in patients
receiving HFOV (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.83–1.72); however, this was based on very low-quality evidence.


The role of HFOV as a rescue technique for refractory ARDS remains unclear; however, we recommend against
its early use in moderate-severe ARDS given the lack of demonstrated benefit and a potential signal for harm.
NIV may have theoretical benefits in patients with sepsis-induced respiratory failure, such as better


**102** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



communication abilities, reduced need for sedation, and avoidance of intubation. However, NIV may preclude
the use of low tidal volume ventilation or achieving adequate levels of PEEP, two ventilation strategies that
have shown benefit even in mild-moderate ARDS (365,386). Also, in contrast to indications such as cardiogenic
pulmonary oedema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation where NIV use is brief, ARDS often
takes days or weeks to improve, and prolonged NIV use may lead to complications such as facial skin breakdown,
inadequate nutritional intake, and failure to rest respiratory muscles.


A few small RCTs have shown benefit with NIV for early or mild ARDS or de novo hypoxic respiratory failure;
however, these were in highly selected patient populations (387,388). More recently, a larger RCT in patients
with hypoxemic respiratory failure compared NIV to traditional oxygen therapy or high-flow nasal cannula (389).
This study demonstrated improved 90-day survival with high-flow oxygen compared with standard therapy or
NIV; however, the NIV technique was not standardized, and the experience of the centres varied. Although highflow oxygen has not been addressed here, it is possible that this technique may play a more prominent role in
the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS moving forward.


Given the uncertainty regarding whether clinicians can identify ARDS patients in whom NIV might be beneficial,
we have not made a recommendation for or against this intervention. If NIV is used for patients with ARDS, we
suggest close monitoring of tidal volumes.


The most common indication for NMBA use in the ICU is to facilitate mechanical ventilation (390). When
appropriately used, these agents may improve chest wall compliance, prevent respiratory dyssynchrony, and
reduce peak airway pressures (391). Muscle paralysis may also reduce oxygen consumption by decreasing the
work of breathing and respiratory muscle blood flow (392). However, a placebo-controlled RCT in patients with
severe sepsis demonstrated that oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and gastric intramucosal pH were not
improved during deep neuromuscular blockade (393).


An RCT of continuous infusions of cisatracurium in patients with early ARDS and a PaO2/FIO2 < 150 mm Hg
showed improved adjusted survival rates and more organ failure-free days without an increased risk in ICUacquired weakness compared with placebo-treated patients (394). The investigators used a high fixed dose
of cisatracurium without train-of-four monitoring; half of the patients in the placebo group received at least a
single NMBA dose. Of note, groups in both the intervention and control groups were ventilated with volumecycled and pressure-limited mechanical ventilation. Although many of the patients in this trial appeared to meet
sepsis criteria, it is not clear whether similar results would occur in sepsis patients or in patients ventilated with
alternate modes. Pooled analysis including three trials that examined the role of NMBAs in ARDS, including the
one above, showed improved survival (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58–0.91) and a decreased frequency of barotrauma
(RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20–0.90) in those receiving NMBAs (395).


An association between NMBA use and myopathies and neuropathies has been suggested by case studies and
prospective observational studies in the critical care population (391,396-399), but the mechanisms by which
NMBAs produce or contribute to myopathies and neuropathies in these patients are unknown. Pooled analysis
of the RCT data did not show an increase in neuromuscular weakness in those who received NMBAs (RR, 1.08;
95% CI, 0.83–1.41); however, this was based on very low quality of evidence (395). Given the uncertainty that
still exists pertaining to these important outcomes and the balance between benefits and potential harms,
the panel decided that a weak recommendation was most suitable. If NMBAs are used, clinicians must ensure
adequate patient sedation and analgesia (400,401); recently updated clinical practice guidelines are available
for specific guidance (402).


Mechanisms for the development of pulmonary oedema in patients with ARDS include increased capillary
permeability, increased hydrostatic pressure, and decreased oncotic pressure (403). Small prospective studies
in patients with critical illness and ARDS have suggested that low weight gain is associated with improved
oxygenation (404) and fewer days of mechanical ventilation (405,406). A fluid-conservative strategy to minimize


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **103**


fluid infusion and weight gain in patients with ARDS, based on either a CVP or a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter
(PA wedge pressure) measurement, along with clinical variables to guide treatment, led to fewer days of
mechanical ventilation and reduced ICU LOS without altering the incidence of renal failure or mortality rates
(407). This strategy was only used in patients with established ARDS, some of whom had shock during their ICU
stay, and active attempts to reduce fluid volume were conducted only outside periods of shock.


Patients with sepsis-induced ARDS often develop increased vascular permeability; preclinical data suggest that
β-adrenergic agonists may hasten resorption of alveolar oedema (408). Three RCTs (646 patients) evaluated
β-agonists in patients with ARDS (408-410). In two of these trials, salbutamol (15 μg/kg of ideal body weight)
delivered intravenously (408,409) was compared with placebo, while the third trial compared inhaled albuterol
versus placebo (410). Group allocation was blinded in all three trials, and two trials were stopped early for
futility or harm (409,411). More than half of the patients enrolled in all three trials had pulmonary or nonpulmonary sepsis as the cause of ARDS.


Pooled analysis suggests β-agonists may reduce survival to hospital discharge in ARDS patients (RR, 1.22; 95% CI,
0.95–1.56) while significantly decreasing the number of ventilator-free days (MD, –2.19; 95% CI, –3.68 to –0.71)
(412). β-agonist use also led to more arrhythmias (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 0.70–5.54) and more tachycardia (RR, 3.95;
95% CI, 1.41–11.06).


β-2 agonists may have specific indications in the critically ill, such as the treatment of bronchospasm and
hyperkalaemia. In the absence of these conditions, we recommend against the use of β-agonists, either in IV or
aerosolized form, for the treatment of patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.


This recommendation is unchanged from the previous guidelines. Although insertion of a PA catheter may
provide useful information regarding volume status and cardiac function, these benefits may be confounded
by differences in interpretation of the results (413,414), poor correlation of PA occlusion pressures with clinical
response (415), and lack of a PA catheter-based strategy demonstrated to improve patient outcomes (416).
Pooled analysis of two multicentre randomized trials, one with 676 patients with shock or ARDS (417) and
another with 1,000 patients with ARDS (418), failed to show any benefit associated with PA catheter use on
mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96–1.09) or ICU LOS (mean difference 0.15 days longer; 95% CI, 0.74 days fewer

- 1.03 days longer) (407,419-421) This lack of demonstrated benefit must be considered in the context of the
increased resources required. Notwithstanding, selected sepsis patients may be candidates for PA catheter
insertion if management decisions depend on information solely obtainable from PA catheter measurements.


Low tidal volume ventilation (4–6 mL/kg) has been shown to be beneficial in patients with established ARDS (422)
by limiting ventilator-induced lung injury. However, the effect of volume- and pressure-limited ventilation is less
clear in patients with sepsis who do not have ARDS. Meta-analysis demonstrates the benefits of low tidal volume
ventilation in patients without ARDS, including a decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD, 0.64
days fewer; 95% CI, 0.49–0.79) and the decreased development of ARDS (RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16–0.57) with no
impact on mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.64–1.41). Importantly, the certainty in this data is limited by indirectness
because the included studies varied significantly in terms of populations enrolled, mostly examining perioperative
patients and very few focusing on ICU patients. The use of low tidal volumes in patients who undergo abdominal
surgery, which may include sepsis patients, has been shown to decrease the incidence of respiratory failure,
shorten LOS, and result in fewer postoperative episodes of sepsis (423). Subgroup analysis of only the studies
that enrolled critically ill patients (424) suggests similar benefits of low tidal volume ventilation on duration of
mechanical ventilation and development of ARDS but is further limited by imprecision given the small number of
studies included. Despite these methodologic concerns, the benefits of low tidal volume ventilation in patients
without ARDS are thought to outweigh any potential harm. Planned RCTs may inform future practice.


The semi-recumbent position has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of VAP (425). Enteral feeding
increased the risk of developing VAP; 50% of the patients who were fed enterally in the supine position


**104** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



developed VAP, compared with 9% of those fed in the semi-recumbent position (425). However, the bed
position was monitored only once a day, and patients who did not achieve the desired bed elevation were
not included in the analysis (425). One study did not show a difference in incidence of VAP between patients
maintained in supine and semi-recumbent positions (426); patients assigned to the semi-recumbent group did
not consistently achieve the desired head-of-bed elevation, and the head-of-bed elevation in the supine group
approached that of the semi-recumbent group by day 7 (426). When necessary, patients may be laid flat when
indicated for procedures, hemodynamic measurements, and during episodes of hypotension. Patients should
not be fed enterally while supine. There were no new published studies since the last guidelines that would
inform a change in the strength of the recommendation for the current iteration. The evidence profile for this
recommendation demonstrated low quality of evidence. The lack of new evidence, along with the low harms
of head-of-bed and high feasibility of implementation given the frequency of the practice resulted in the strong
recommendation. There is a small subgroup of patients, such as trauma patients with a spine injury, for whom
this recommendation would not apply.


Spontaneous breathing trial options include a low level of pressure support, CPAP (≈5 cm H2O), or use of a
T-piece. A recently published clinical practice guideline suggests the use of inspiratory pressure augmentation
rather than T-piece or CPAP for an initial spontaneous breathing trial for acutely hospitalized adults on mechanical
ventilation for more than 24 hours (427). Daily spontaneous breathing trials in appropriately selected patients
reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and weaning duration both in individual trials as well as with
pooled analysis of the individual trials (428-430). These breathing trials should be conducted in conjunction
with a spontaneous awakening trial (431). Successful completion of spontaneous breathing trials leads to a high
likelihood of successful early discontinuation of mechanical ventilation with minimal demonstrated harm.


Protocols allow for standardization of clinical pathways to facilitate desired treatment (432). These protocols
may include both spontaneous breathing trials, gradual reduction of support, and computer-generated
weaning. Pooled analysis demonstrates that patients treated with protocolized weaning compared with usual
care experienced shorter weaning duration (–39 hours; 95% CI, –67 hours to –11 hours), and shorter ICU LOS
(–9 hours; 95% CI, –15 to –2). There was no difference between groups in ICU mortality (OR, 0.93; 95% CI,
0.58–1.48) or need for reintubation (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.44–1.23) (428).

**Implementation Point 20 (Recommendation 48)**
Ventilated patients should be routinely measured for height to facilitate ideal body weight-based calculations of
tidal volumes and where possible, for weight to facilitate drug dosing and nutritional requirements calculations.


**Role and Responsibilities**
It is the responsibility of all clinicians to routinely assess patient’s height and body weight to facilitate drug
dosing and nutritional requirement calculations.


**3.1.12 Sedation and Analgesia**


**Key question**

 - In mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis, should we use sedation targets?


**SSCG Rationale**


Limiting the use of sedation in critically ill ventilated patients reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation
and ICU and hospital LOS and allows for earlier mobilization (433,434). While these data arise from studies
performed in a wide range of critically ill patients, there is little reason to believe that septic patients will not
derive the same benefits from sedation minimization.


Several strategies have been shown to reduce sedative use and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Nursedirected protocols that incorporate a sedation scale likely result in improved outcomes; however, the benefit
depends on the existing local culture and practice (435,436). Another option for systematically limiting the
use of sedation is the administration of intermittent rather than continuous sedation (437,438). Daily sedation
interruption (DSI) was associated with improved outcomes in a single-centre randomized trial compared with
usual care (430); however, in a multicentre RCT there was no advantage to DSI when patients were managed
with a sedation protocol whilst nurses perceived a higher workload (439). A recent Cochrane meta-analysis did
not find strong evidence that DSI alters the duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, ICU or hospital LOS,
adverse event rates, or drug consumption for critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation compared to
sedation strategies that do not include DSI; however, interpretation of the results is limited by imprecision and
clinical heterogeneity (440). Another strategy is the primary use of opioids alone and avoidance of sedatives,
which was shown to be feasible in the majority of ventilated patients in a single-centre trial and was associated
with more rapid liberation from mechanical ventilation (441). Finally, the use of short-acting drugs such as
propofol and dexmedetomidine may result in better outcomes than the use of benzodiazepines (442-444). Recent
pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines provide additional detail on implementation of sedation management,
including nonpharmacologic approaches for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium (445).
Regardless of approach, a large body of indirect evidence is available demonstrating the benefit of limiting
sedation in those requiring mechanical ventilation and without contraindication. As such, this should be best
practice for any critically ill patient, including those with sepsis.


**Recommendation 63.** (SSCG Section N, Recommendation 1).
We recommend that continuous or intermittent sedation be minimized in mechanically ventilated sepsis
patients, targeting specific titration end points.
**Quality/level of evidence: Low        + Strength of recommendation: BPS**


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **107**


**Implementation Point 21 (Recommendation 63)**
Practice guidelines for the management of pain, agitation and delirium should be adopted in all intensive care
units.


**Roles and Responsibilities (Implementation point 21)**
Clinicians are responsible to ensure patients receive the minimum sedation necessary to reduce delirium and
facilitate early rehabilitation. The aims of sedation should be outlined, and levels monitored. Pain, agitation
and delirium are common complications among sepsis patients admitted to the ICU and are associated with
extended ICU length of stay and increased risk of developing neuropathic pain, cognitive impairment, and posttraumatic stress disorder (Barr et al., 2013). Implementation of care bundles recommended by clinical practice
guidelines could improve clinical outcomes in this domain (Mansouri et al., 2013) (Trogrlić et al., 2015).

**3.1.13 Glucose Control**


**Key questions**

 - Should we use intensive insulin therapy in patients with sepsis or septic shock?

 - Should we use arterial blood glucose level (versus point of care testing) in critically ill patients with severe
sepsis or septic shock on insulin infusion?


**SSCG Rationale**


A large single-centre RCT in 2001 demonstrated a reduction in ICU mortality with intensive IV insulin (Leuven
protocol) targeting blood glucose to 80–110 mg/dL (446). A second randomized trial of intensive insulin therapy
using the Leuven protocol enrolled medical ICU patients with an anticipated ICU LOS of more than three days in
three medical ICUs; overall mortality was not reduced 447).


Since these studies (446,447) appeared, several RCTs (448-455) and meta-analyses (456-462) of intensive
insulin therapy have been performed. The RCTs studied mixed populations of surgical and medical ICU patients
and found that intensive insulin therapy did not significantly decrease mortality, whereas the NICE-SUGAR trial
demonstrated an increased mortality (451). All studies reported a much higher incidence of severe hypoglycaemia
(glucose ≤ 40 mg/dL) (6%−29%) with intensive insulin therapy. Several meta-analyses confirmed that intensive
insulin therapy was not associated with a mortality benefit in surgical, medical, or mixed ICU patients. The
meta-analysis by Song et al (462) evaluated only septic patients and found that intensive insulin therapy did not
change 28-day or 90-day mortality but was associated with a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia. The trigger
to start an insulin protocol for blood glucose levels > 180 mg/dL with an upper target blood glucose level <
180 mg/dL derives from the NICE-SUGAR trial, which used these values for initiating and stopping therapy.
The NICE-SUGAR trial is the largest, most compelling study to date on glucose control in ICU patients given
its inclusion of multiple ICUs and hospitals and a general patient population. Several medical organizations,
including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Diabetes Association, American Heart
Association, American College of Physicians, and Society of Critical Care Medicine, have published consensus
statements for glycaemic control of hospitalized patients (463,464). These statements usually targeted glucose
levels between 140 and 180 mg/dL. Because there is no evidence that targets between 140 and 180 mg/dL are
different from targets of 110 to 140 mg/dL, the present recommendations use an upper target blood glucose ≤
180 mg/dL without a lower target other than hypoglycaemia. Stricter ranges, such as 110–140 mg/dL, may be
appropriate for selected patients if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycaemia (463,465). Treatment
should avoid hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dL), hypoglycaemia, and wide swings in glucose levels that have been
associated with higher mortality (466-471). The continuation of insulin infusions, especially with the cessation
of nutrition, has been identified as a risk factor for hypoglycaemia (454). Balanced nutrition may be associated
with a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia (472). Hyperglycaemia and glucose variability seem to be unassociated


**108** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



with increased mortality rates in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic patients (473-475). Patients with
diabetes and chronic hyperglycaemia, end-stage renal failure, or medical versus surgical ICU patients may
require higher blood glucose ranges (476,477).


Several factors may affect the accuracy and reproducibility of point-of-care testing of blood capillary blood glucose,
including the type and model of the device used, user expertise, and patient factors, including haematocrit
(false elevation with anaemia), PaO2, and drugs (478). Plasma glucose values by capillary point-of-care testing
have been found to be potentially inaccurate, with frequent false elevations (479-481) over the range of glucose
levels, but especially in the hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic ranges (482) and in shock patients (receiving
vasopressors) (478,480). A review of studies found the accuracy of glucose measurements by arterial blood
gas analysers and glucose meters by using arterial blood significantly higher than measurements with glucose
meters using capillary blood (480). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has stated that “critically ill patients
should not be tested with a glucose meter because results may be inaccurate,” and Centres for Medicare and
Medicaid Services have plans to enforce the prohibition of off-label use of point-of-care capillary blood glucose
monitor testing in critically ill patients (483). Several medical experts have stated the need for a moratorium on
this plan (484). Despite the attempt to protect patients from harm because of inaccurate capillary blood testing,
a prohibition might cause more harm because a central laboratory test may take significantly longer to provide
results than point-of-care glucometer testing.


A review of 12 published insulin infusion protocols for critically ill patients showed wide variability in dose
recommendations and variable glucose control (485). This lack of consensus about optimal dosing of IV insulin
may reflect variability in patient factors (severity of illness, surgical versus medical settings), or practice patterns
(e.g., approaches to feeding, IV dextrose) in the environments in which these protocols were developed and
tested. Alternatively, some protocols may be more effective than others, a conclusion supported by the wide
variability in hypoglycaemia rates reported with protocols. Thus, the use of established insulin protocols is
important not only for clinical care, but also for the conduct of clinical trials to avoid hypoglycaemia, adverse
events, and premature termination of trials before the efficacy signal, if any, can be determined. Several studies
have suggested that computer-based algorithms result in tighter glycaemic control with a reduced risk of
hypoglycaemia (486,487). Computerized decision support systems and fully automated closed-loop systems for
glucose control are feasible, but not yet standard care. Further study of validated, safe, and effective protocols
and closed-loop systems for controlling blood glucose concentrations and variability in the sepsis population is
needed.


**Recommendation 64.** (SSCG Section O, Recommendation 1).
We recommend a protocolized approach to blood glucose management in ICU patients with sepsis,
commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are >10mmol/L (180mg/dL). This
approach should target an upper blood glucose level ≤10mmol/L (180mg/dL) rather than an upper target
blood glucose level ≤6.1mmol/L (110mg/dL).
**Quality/level of evidence: High** **+ Strength of recommendation: Strong**

**Recommendation 65.** (SSCG Section O, Recommendation 2).
We recommend that blood glucose values be monitored every 1 to 2 hours until glucose values and insulin
infusion rates are stable, then every 4 hours thereafter in patients receiving insulin infusions.

**Recommendation 66.** (SSCG Section O, Recommendation 3).

Clinicians are responsible to ensure that guidelines for the management of diabetes are adopted outside of the
intensive care units.


**3.1.14 Renal replacement therapy**


**Key questions**

 - In patients with sepsis and indication for haemodialysis, should we use CRRT versus intermittent
haemodialysis?

 - In patients with sepsis and AKI with no indication for hemodialysis, should we use renal replacement therapy
versus not?


**SSCG Rationale**


Although numerous nonrandomized studies have reported a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival using
continuous methods (488–494), two meta-analyses (495, 496) reported the absence of significant differences in
hospital mortality between patients who receive CRRT and intermittent RRT. This absence of apparent benefit of
one modality over the other persists even when the analysis is restricted to RCTs (496). To date, five prospective
RCTs have been published (497–501); four found no significant difference in mortality (497, 498, 500, 501),
whereas one found significantly higher mortality in the continuous treatment group (499); but imbalanced
randomization had led to a higher baseline severity of illness in this group. When a multivariable model was
used to adjust for severity of illness, no difference in mortality was apparent between the groups. Most studies
comparing modes of RRT in the critically ill have included a small number of outcomes and had a high risk of
bias (e.g., randomization failure, modifications of therapeutic protocol during the study period, combination
of different types of CRRT, small number of heterogeneous groups of enrolees). The most recent and largest
RCT (501) enrolled 360 patients and found no significant difference in survival between the continuous and
intermittent groups. We judged the overall certainty of the evidence to be moderate and not in support of
continuous therapies in sepsis independent of renal replacement needs.


For this revision of the guidelines, no additional RCTs evaluating the hemodynamic tolerance of continuous
versus intermittent RRT were identified. Accordingly, the limited and inconsistent evidence persists. Two
prospective trials (497, 502) have reported a better hemodynamic tolerance with continuous treatment, with
no improvement in regional perfusion (502) and no survival benefit (497). Four other studies did not find any
significant difference in MAP or drop in systolic pressure between the two methods (498, 500, 501, 503). Two
studies reported a significant improvement in goal achievement with continuous methods (497, 499) regarding
fluid balance management.


Two additional RCTs reporting the effect of dose of CRRT on outcomes in patients with acute renal failure were
identified in the current literature review (504, 505). Both studies enrolled patients with sepsis and acute kidney
injury and did not demonstrate any difference in mortality associated with a higher dose of RRT. Two large,


**110** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



multicentre, randomized trials comparing the dose of renal replacement (Acute Renal Failure Trial Network in
the United States and RENAL Study in Australia and New Zealand) also failed to show benefit of more aggressive
renal replacement dosing (506, 507). A meta-analysis of the sepsis patients included in all relevant RCTs (n
= 1,505) did not demonstrate any significant relationship between dose and mortality; the point estimate,
however, favours CRRT doses > 30 mL/kg/hr. Because of risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, confidence
in the estimate is very low; further research is indicated. A typical dose for CRRT would be 20–25 mL/kg/hr of
effluent generation.


One small trial from 2002 (504) evaluated early versus “late” or “delayed” initiation of RRT; it included only four
patients with sepsis and did not show any benefit of early CRRT. Since then, two relevant RCTs (508, 509) were
published in 2016. Results suggest the possibility of either benefit (509) or harm (508) for mortality, increased
use of dialysis, and increased central line infections with early RRT. Enrolment criteria and timing of initiation
of RRT differed in the two trials. Results were judged to be of low certainty based on indirectness (many nonseptic patients) and imprecision for mortality. The possibility of harm (e.g., central line infections) pushes the
balance of risk and benefit against early initiation of RRT. Meanwhile, the undesirable effects and costs appear
to outweigh the desirable consequences; therefore, we suggest not using RRT in patients with sepsis and acute
kidney injury for increase in creatinine or oliguria without other definitive indications for dialysis.


**Recommendation 68.** (SSCG Section P, Recommendation 1).
We suggest that either continuous RRT (CRRT) or intermittent RRT be used in patients with sepsis and acute
kidney injury.

We **suggest against** the use of RRT in patients with sepsis and acute kidney injury for increase in creatinine or
oliguria without other definitive indications for dialysis.
**Quality/level of evidence: Low            + Strength of recommendation: Weak**


**3.1.15 Bicarbonate therapy**


**Key question**

 - In patients with sepsis or septic shock and hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidosis, should we use sodium
bicarbonate therapy?


**SSCG Rationale**


Although sodium bicarbonate therapy may be useful in limiting tidal volume in ARDS in some situations of
permissive hypercapnia, no evidence supports the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy in the treatment of
hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidaemia associated with sepsis. Two blinded, crossover RCTs that compared
equimolar saline and sodium bicarbonate in patients with lactic acidosis failed to reveal any difference in
hemodynamic variables or vasopressor requirements (510, 511). The number of patients with < 7.15 pH in
these studies was small, and we downgraded the certainty of evidence for serious imprecision; further, patients
did not exclusively have septic shock, but also had other diseases, such as mesenteric ischemia. Bicarbonate
administration has been associated with sodium and fluid overload, an increase in lactate and Paco2, and a


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **111**


decrease in serum ionized calcium, but the directness of these variables to outcome is uncertain. The effect of
sodium bicarbonate administration on haemodynamics and vasopressor requirements at lower pH, as well as
the effect on clinical outcomes at any pH level, is unknown. No studies have examined the effect of bicarbonate
administration on outcomes. This recommendation is unchanged from the 2012 guidelines.


**Recommendation 71.** (SSCG Section Q, Recommendation 1).
We **suggest against** the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy to improve haemodynamics or to reduce
vasopressor requirements in patients with hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidaemia with pH ≥ 7.15
**Quality/level of evidence: Moderate            + Strength of recommendation: Weak**


**3.1.16 Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis**


**Key questions**

 - Should we use pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (UFH or LMWH) in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic
shock?

 - Should we use LMWH (versus UFH) for VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock?

 - Should we use mechanical VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock?

 - Should we use a combination of pharmacologic and mechanical prophylaxis vs. either alone in critically ill
patients with sepsis or septic shock?


**SSCG Rationale**


ICU patients are at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as well as pulmonary embolism (PE). The incidence of
DVT acquired in the ICU may be as high as 10% (512); the incidence of acquired PE may be 2%–4% (513, 514).
Patients with sepsis and septic shock are likely at increased risk for this complication. Vasopressor use, which is
frequent in these patients, has been found to be an independent risk factor for ICU-acquired DVT.


A meta-analysis of pharmacologic prophylaxis with UFH or LMWH in critically ill patients showed significant
reductions in both DVT and PE, with no significant increase in bleeding complications. Mortality was lower in the
patients receiving prophylaxis, although this did not reach statistical significance (514). All studies included in the
meta-analysis were cited in the 2012 guideline, which recommended pharmacologic prophylaxis. No additional
prospective randomized controlled trials related to this topic have been identified since the meta-analysis and
the previous guideline were published (Supplemental Digital Content 12, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C333).
Data in support of pharmacologic prophylaxis are considered somewhat indirect. Except for a large prospective
randomized controlled trial comparing VTE in septic patients treated with drotrecogin alfa who were randomized
to receive placebo versus UFH versus LWMH (515), all studies have been in an undifferentiated population
of critically ill patients. Overall, we made a strong recommendation in favour of pharmacologic prophylaxis
against VTE in critically ill patients based on the overall efficacy of this intervention, although the evidence was
downgraded to moderate because of indirectness of the populations studied.


A number of studies have also compared use of LMWH to UFH for prevention of VTE prophylaxis in critically ill
patients. Four trials were included in the meta-analysis of Alhazzani et al (514). We did not identify any new trials
since then. In this meta-analysis, the overall rate of DVT was lower in patients receiving LWMH compared to
UFH, and overall mortality was reduced by 7%; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance.
In those trials evaluating PE, the rates were significantly lower in patients receiving LWMH. As with all studies
of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, only one trial (515) was restricted to septic patients, and that trial utilized
drotrecogin alfa in all patients. An additional meta-analysis found that LWMH was more effective than UFH in


**112** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



reducing the incidence of DVT and PE in critically ill patients (516). However, the authors of this meta-analysis
included studies of critically ill trauma patients.


All studies of LMWH have compared these agents against UFH administered twice daily. No high-quality studies in
critically ill patients have directly compared LWMH against UFH administered thrice daily. An indirect comparison
meta-analysis published in 2011 failed to identify a significant difference in efficacy between twice-daily and
thrice-daily heparin in medical patients (517). However, another review and meta-analysis (also using indirect
comparison) suggested greater efficacy but higher rates of bleeding with thrice-daily UFH (518). A Cochrane
review demonstrated a substantial decrease in the incidence of HIT in postoperative patients receiving LMWH
compared to UFH (519), although the studies were not specific to either septic or critically ill patients. Finally, a
cost-effectiveness analysis based on one trial of LMWH versus UFH (520) suggested that use of LMWH resulted
in an overall decrease in costs of care, despite the higher acquisition cost of the pharmaceutical agent (521).
Overall, the desirable consequences (i.e., reduction in PE, HIT, cost savings, and ease of administration) of using
LMWH clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences; therefore, we made a strong recommendation in favour
of LMWH instead of UFH, whenever feasible. However, the evidence for this was considered only of moderate
quality because of indirectness, both with respect to the populations studied and also because LMWH has only
been systematically compared to UFH administered twice daily and not thrice daily.


Precautions are generally suggested regarding use of LMWH in patients with renal dysfunction. In a preliminary
trial, no accumulation of anti-Xa levels was demonstrated with dalteparin in patients with a calculated creatinine
clearance < 30 mL/min (522). Thus, these patients were included in the PROTECT study (520). In the actual trial,
118 patients with renal failure were analysed, 60 of whom were randomized to dalteparin and 58 to UFH. There
was no evidence of untoward reactions in patients receiving dalteparin compared to UFH. However, dalteparin
was not more efficacious than UFH in this small number of patients. These investigators speculated that other
types of LMWH might be safe to use in patients with renal failure but acknowledged no other high-quality data
to support this theory. Thus, use of LMWH in septic patients with renal dysfunction might be an option, but data
in support of that remain quite limited.


Combined pharmacologic prophylaxis and mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression
(IPC) and/or graduated compression stockings (GCS) is a potential option in critically ill patients with sepsis and
septic shock. No high-quality studies of this approach in septic patients, or even critically ill patients in general,
exist; however, further research is ongoing (523). A Cochrane review (524) of 11 studies in surgical patients
suggested that combined prophylaxis was more effective than either modality used alone. However, the quality
of evidence was low due to indirectness of population and imprecision of estimates. Therefore, we can make
only a weak recommendation for combined modality therapy for VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients with
sepsis or septic shock. Recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines made no recommendation
regarding the use of combined modality in critically ill patients but do suggest use of combined mechanical and
pharmacologic prophylaxis in high-risk surgical patients (525, 526).


A significant number of septic patients may have relative contraindications to the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis.
These patients may be candidates for mechanical prophylaxis using IPC and/or GCS. However, relatively little
data exist regarding this approach in critically ill patients. Two meta-analyses have been published comparing
use of mechanical prophylaxis with no prophylaxis in combined patient groups, primarily those undergoing
orthopaedic surgery (527, 528). The former meta-analysis focused on use of GCS and the latter on use of IPC. In
these analyses, both modalities appeared more effective than no mechanical prophylaxis, but variable numbers
of patients received pharmacologic prophylaxis in both arms, making this evidence indirect. A cohort study of
798 patients using propensity scores for risk adjustment concluded that IPC was the only effective means for
mechanical VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients; however, there was heavy use of pharmacologic prophylaxis
in all groups (529). Overall, based on these data, we made a weak recommendation for using mechanical
prophylaxis in critically ill septic patients with contraindications to use of pharmacologic prophylaxis. Very
limited evidence indicates that IPC may be more effective than GCS alone in critically ill patients, making it the
preferred modality for mechanical prophylaxis.

**Recommendation 72.** (SSCG Section R, Recommendation 1).
We recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low-molecular-weight heparin

[LMWH]) against venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the absence of contraindications to the use of these
agents (SSCG Section G, Recommendation 6).
**Quality/level of evidence: Moderate** **+ Strength of recommendation: Strong**

**Implementation Point 23 (Recommendations 72-75)**
VTE prophylaxis for unwell pregnant women with sepsis should be in line with existing VTE guidelines considering
risk factors as outlined in the RCOG and RCPI guidelines (RCOG, 2015) (RCPI, 2016). If there is evidence of
coagulopathy a haematologist should be consulted for guidance on how best to manage care.


**Roles and responsibility (Implementation 23)**
Clinicians are responsible to ensure that VTE prophylaxis is in line with existing VTE guidelines and that a
haematologist is consulted if there is evidence of coagulopathy.


**3.1.17 Stress ulcer prophylaxis**


**Key questions**

 - Should we use stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill septic patients?

 - Should we use PPIs (versus H2RA) for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill septic patients?


**SSCG Rationale**


Stress ulcers develop in the GI tract of critically ill patients and can be associated with significant morbidity and
mortality (530). The exact mechanism is not completely understood but is believed to be related to disruption
of protective mechanisms against gastric acid, gastric mucosal hypoperfusion, increased acid production, and
oxidative injury to the digestive track (531). The strongest clinical predictors of GI bleeding risk in critically
ill patients are mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours and coagulopathy (532). A recent international cohort
study showed that pre-existing liver disease, need for RRT, and higher organ failure scores were independent
predictors of GI bleeding risk (533).


**114** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



A multicentre prospective cohort study found the incidence of clinically important GI bleeding to be 2.6% (95%
CI, 1.6%–3.6%) in critically ill patients (533); however, other observational studies showed lower rates of GI
bleeding (534-537).


A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 RCTs examined the efficacy and safety of stress ulcer
prophylaxis (538). Moderate quality of evidence showed that prophylaxis with either H2RAs or PPIs reduced the
risk of GI bleeding compared to no prophylaxis (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28–0.68; low quality of evidence showed a
nonsignificant increase in pneumonia risk (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.86–1.78) (538). Recently, a large, retrospective
cohort study examined the effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis in patients with sepsis and found no significant
difference in the risk of C difficile infection compared to no prophylaxis (539) (Supplemental Digital Content 13,
http://links.lww.com/CCM/C334). The choice of prophylactic agent should depend on patients’ characteristics,
patients’ values and preferences, and the local incidence of C difficile infections and pneumonia.


Although published RCTs did not exclusively include septic patients, risk factors for GI bleeding are frequently
present in patients with sepsis and septic shock (532); therefore, using the results to inform our recommendations
is acceptable. Based on the available evidence, the desirable consequences of stress ulcer prophylaxis outweigh
the undesirable consequences; therefore, we made a strong recommendation in favour of using stress ulcer
prophylaxis in patients with risk factors. Patients without risk factors are unlikely to develop clinically important
GI bleeding during their ICU stay (532); therefore, stress ulcer prophylaxis should only be used when risk factors
are present, and patients should be periodically evaluated for the continued need for prophylaxis.


While there is variation in practice worldwide, several surveys showed that PPIs are the most frequently used
agents in North America, Australia, and Europe, followed by H2RAs (540-544). A recent meta-analysis including
19 RCTs (n = 2,177) showed that PPIs were more effective than H2RAs in preventing clinically important GI
bleeding (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.21–0.71; p = 0.002; moderate quality) but led to a nonsignificant increase in
pneumonia risk (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.88–1.56; p = 0.28; low quality) (544) prior meta-analyses reached a similar
conclusion (545,546). None of the RCTs reported the risk of C difficile infection; nonetheless, a large retrospective
cohort study demonstrated a small increase in the risk of C difficile infection with PPIs compared to H2RAs (2.2%
vs. 3.8%; p < 0.001; very low-quality evidence). Studies reporting patients’ values and preferences concerning
the efficacy and safety of these agents are essentially lacking. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analyses reached
different conclusions (547,548).


Consequently, the benefit of preventing GI bleeding (moderate-quality evidence) must be weighed against the
potential increase in infectious complications (very low- to low-quality evidence). The choice of prophylactic
agent will largely depend on individual patients’ characteristics; patients’ values; and the local prevalence of GI
bleeding, pneumonia, and C difficile infection. Because of the uncertainties, we did not recommend one agent
over the other. Ongoing trials aim to investigate the benefit and harm of withholding stress ulcer prophylaxis
(clinicaltrials.gov registration NCT02290327, NCT02467621). The results of these trials will inform future
recommendations.

**SSCG Rationale**


Parenteral nutrition delivery can secure the intended number of calories. This may represent an advantage over
enteral nutrition, especially when patients may be underfed due to GI intolerance, which may be pertinent over
the first days of care in the ICU. However, parenteral delivery is more invasive and has been associated with
complications, including an increased risk of infections. Further, purported physiologic benefits are associated
with enteral feeding, which make this strategy the mainstay of care (549). To address the question of the
superiority of parenteral nutrition for patients with sepsis and septic shock, we evaluated the evidence for
patients who could be fed enterally early versus those for whom early enteral feeding was not feasible.


Our first systematic review examined the impact of an early parenteral feeding strategy alone or in combination
with enteral feeding versus enteral feeding alone on mortality in patients who could be fed enterally. We
identified a total of 10 trials with 2,888 patients that were conducted in heterogeneous critically ill and surgical
patients, trauma and traumatic brain injury, and those with severe acute pancreatitis (550–559). No evidence
showed that early parenteral nutrition reduced mortality (RR 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87–1.08; n = 2,745) or infection
risk (RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.88–2.62; n = 2,526), but ICU LOS was increased (MD, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.38–1.42; n = 46).

The quality of the evidence was graded as moderate to very low. In the largest randomized trial that addressed
this study question (CALORIES, n = 2,400), there were fewer episodes of hypoglycaemia and vomiting in the
early parenteral group, but no differences in death between the study groups (553, 560). Due to the lack of
mortality benefit, the added cost of parenteral nutrition in absence of clinical benefit (550, 551, 555, 560), and
the potential physiologic benefits of enteral feeding (549, 561, 562), we recommend early enteral nutrition as
the preferred route of administration in patients with sepsis or septic shock who can be fed enterally.


In some patients with sepsis or septic shock, feeding enterally early may not be feasible because of
contraindications related to surgery or feeding intolerance. These patients represent another subgroup of
critically ill patients for whom the clinician may question whether to start parenteral nutrition early with or
without some enteral feeding to meet nutritional goals, versus trophic/hypocaloric enteral feeding alone, or
nothing except the addition of IV glucose/dextrose for the provision of some calories. To address this question,
we conducted a systematic review, which included a total of four trials and 6,087 patients (563–566). Two of
the included trials accounted for 98.5% of the patients included in the review and, of these trials, more than
65% of the patients were surgical critically ill patients (564, 567). Seven (20%) of the patients from these two
trials were considered septic and patients with malnourishment were either excluded or represented a very
small fraction (n = 46, 3.3%) of the included patients. In three of the included trials, parenteral nutrition was
initiated if enteral feeding was not tolerated after the first 7 days of care (564, 566, 567). Our review found that
early parenteral nutrition with or without supplementation of enteral nutrition was not associated with reduced
mortality (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79–1.16; n = 6,087; moderate-quality evidence) but was associated with increased
risk of infection (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02–1.24; 3 trials; n = 6,054; moderate-quality evidence) (Supplemental
Digital Content 14, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C335). Length of ventilation outcomes were reported divergently
in the two large trials, with one suggesting an increase (567) and the other a decrease (564) in ventilation time
associated with early parenteral nutrition. One trial also reported less muscle wasting and fat loss in the early
parenteral nutrition group according to a Subjective Global Assessment Score (564). In summary, due to the lack
of mortality benefit, the increased risk of infection, and the extra cost for parenteral nutrition in the absence
of clinical benefit (568), current evidence does not support the initiation of early parenteral nutrition over the
first 7 days of care for patients with contraindications or intolerance to enteral nutrition. Specific patient groups
may benefit more or incur more harm with early initiation of parenteral nutrition in this context. We encourage
future research according to individual patient level meta-analyses to characterize these subgroups and plan for
future randomized trials. It is important to note that patients who were malnourished were either excluded or
rarely represented in the included trials from our systematic review. Since so few malnourished patients were
enrolled, evidence to guide practice is lacking. Malnourished patients may represent a subgroup of critically ill
patients for whom the clinician may consider initiating parenteral nutrition early when enteral feeding is not
feasible.


The early administration of enteral nutrition in patients with sepsis and septic shock has potential physiologic
advantages related to the maintenance of gut integrity and prevention of intestinal permeability, dampening
of the inflammatory response, and modulation of metabolic responses that may reduce insulin resistance
(561,562). To examine evidence for this nutrition strategy, we asked if early full feeding (started within the first
48 hours and feeding goals to be met within 72 hours of ICU admission or injury) as compared to a delayed
strategy (feeds delayed for at least 48 hours) improved the outcome of our critically ill patients. In our systematic
review, we identified a total of 11 trials in heterogeneous critically ill patient populations (n = 412 patients) (569579). Only one trial was specifically conducted in patients with sepsis (n = 43 patients) (577). The risk of death
was not significantly different between the groups (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.43–1.31; n = 188 patients), and infections
were not significantly reduced (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34–12.07; n = 122 patients). Other recent systematic reviews
in the critically ill focused specifically on trauma (3 trials, n = 126 patients) or more heterogeneous critically
ill populations (6 trials, n = 234 patients) and found that early enteral feeding reduced death and pneumonia
(580,581). However, in contrast to our systematic review, these latter reviews did not include studies in which
enteral feeding in the intervention arm was both early and full and where the control arm feeding strategy was


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **117**


delayed for at least the first 48 hours. We also examined whether the provision of an early trophic/hypocaloric
feeding strategy (defined by enteral feeding started within the first 48 hours and up to 70% of target caloric goals
for at least 48 hours) was superior to a delayed enteral feeding strategy. In the two trials that fit these criteria,
there were no statistical differences in death (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.35–1.29; n = 229; low-quality evidence) or
infection (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.61–1.37; n = 229; very low-quality evidence) between the groups (582,583). Since
the present evidence does not suggest harm with early versus delayed institution of enteral feeding, and there
is possible benefit from physiologic evidence suggesting reduced gut permeability, inflammation, and infection
risk, the committee issued a weak recommendation to start feeding early in patients with sepsis and septic
shock.


Some evidence suggests that intentional early underfeeding as compared to early full feeding of critically ill
patients may lead to immune hyporesponsiveness and an increase in infectious complications (549). Further,
because critical illness is associated with loss of skeletal mass, it is possible that not administering adequate
protein may lead to challenges weaning from the ventilator and more general weakness. However, a biological
rationale for a trophic/hypocaloric or hypocaloric feeding strategy exists, at least as the initial approach to
feeding the critically ill as compared to a fully fed strategy. Limiting caloric intake stimulates autophagy, which
is considered a defence mechanism against intracellular organisms and therefore raises the possibility that this
approach could reduce infection risk (584,585).


We defined feeds as trophic/hypocaloric if goal feeds were 70% or less of standard caloric targets for at least a
48-hour period before they were titrated toward goal. Our systematic review identified seven randomized trials
and 2,665 patients studied (584,586-591). Patient populations included heterogeneous critically ill patients and
those with acute lung injury and/or ARDS. Patients who were malnourished were excluded from four of the trials
(588-591) and the average body mass index in the remaining three trials ranged from 28 to 30 (584,586,587).
Targets for trophic/hypocaloric feeding groups ranged from 10 to 20 kcal/hr to up to 70% of target goal. Study
intervention periods ranged from 6 to 14 days (or until ICU discharge). In three of the trials, protein (0.8–1.5 g/
kg/d) was administered to the trophic/hypocaloric group to meet protein requirements (584,586,587). Overall,
there were no differences in mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.82–1.10; n = 2,665; high-quality evidence), infections
(RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83–1.12; n = 2,667; moderate-quality evidence), or ICU LOS (MD, –0.27 days; 95% CI, –1.40
to 0.86, n = 2,567; moderate-quality evidence between the study groups) (Supplemental Digital Content 15,
http://links.lww.com/CCM/C336). One trial that instituted hypocaloric feeding (goal 40%–60% target feeds for
up to 14 days) reported a subgroup of 292 patients with sepsis; there were also no detectable differences in
death at 90 days between the study groups (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.71–1.27; p = 0.82 for interaction) (584). A
recently published systematic review of normocaloric versus hypocaloric feeding also found no differences in
hospital mortality, infections, ICU LOS, or ventilator-free days between the study groups (585). Some evidence
also suggests a lack of adverse consequences even with longer-term outcomes. A trophic/hypocaloric feeding
trial of 525 patients, which instituted the most significant restrictions in enteral feeding (20% of caloric goal) for
up to 6 days, found no differences in muscle strength, muscle mass, and 6-minute walk test at 6 months or 1 year,
although patients in the trophic/hypocaloric feeding group were more likely to be admitted to a rehabilitation
facility during the first 12 months of follow-up (592). The current evidence base would suggest that a trophic/
hypocaloric or early full enteral feeding strategy is appropriate. However, for patients with sepsis or septic
shock who are not tolerating enteral feeds, trophic/hypocaloric feeding may be preferred, with feeds titrated
over time according to patient tolerance. There is insufficient evidence to confirm that a trophic/hypocaloric
feeding strategy is effective and safe in patients who are malnourished (body mass index < 18.5) because these
patients were either excluded or rarely represented in the clinical trials from our systematic review. Until further
clinical evidence is generated for this subpopulation, the clinician may consider titrating enteral feeds more
aggressively in accordance with patient tolerance while monitoring for re-feeding syndrome. Current evidence
did not specifically address patients with high vasopressor requirements, and the decision about withholding
the feeds should be individualized.

Use of omega-3 fatty acids in the context of clinical trials in the critically ill has been a subject of interest
during the past several years because of the immunomodulatory potential (593). However, systematic reviews
of parenteral or enteral omega-3 supplementation in critically ill and ARDS patients have not confirmed their
therapeutic benefit (594,595). Further, a recent randomized trial of 272 patients with acute lung injury found
excess harm related to mortality as well as fewer ventilator- and ICU-free days in the omega-3 arm as compared
to the control arm (596). A limitation of this trial as well as several other omega-3 trials is that the intervention
arm also contained vitamins and trace mineral supplementation, making omega-3 fatty acids alone difficult to
isolate as the cause for harm or benefit. For these reasons, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials
in the critically ill that administered omega-3 alone in the intervention arm. In a total of 16 trials (n = 1,216
patients), there were no significant reductions in death (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.71–1.03; low quality evidence);
however, ICU LOS was significantly reduced in the omega-3 group (MD, –3.84 days; 95% CI, –5.57 to –2.12, very
low-quality evidence). The overall quality of the evidence was graded as low. Due to the uncertainty of benefit,
the potential for harm, and the excess cost and varied availability of omega-3 fatty acids, we make a strong
recommendation against the use of omega-3 fatty acids for patients with sepsis and septic shock outside the
conduct of RCTs.


Critically ill patients are at significant risk for GI dysmotility, which may then predispose them to regurgitation
or vomiting, aspiration, and the development of aspiration pneumonia. The rationale for measurement of GRVs
is to reduce the risk for aspiration pneumonia by either ceasing or modifying the enteral feeding strategy based
on the detection of excess gastric residuals. The inherent controversy is that observational and interventional
studies have not consistently confirmed a relationship between the measurement of GRVs (with thresholds
ranging from 200 mL to no monitoring of GRVs) and outcomes of vomiting, aspiration, or pneumonia (597-603).
In our systematic review, we identified one multicentre non-inferiority trial of 452 critically ill patients who
were randomized to not monitoring GRVs versus monitoring GRVs at 6-hour intervals (602). Intolerance to feeds
was defined as vomiting in the intervention group versus a GRV of > 250 mL, vomiting, or both in the control
group. Although vomiting was more frequent (39.6% versus 27%; median difference, 12.6; 95% CI, 5.4–19.9) in
the group in which GRVs were not monitored, a strategy of not monitoring GRVs was found to be non-inferior
compared to monitoring at 6-hour intervals with regard to the primary outcome of VAP (16.7% versus 15.8%
respectively; difference, 0.9%; 95% CI, –4.8% to 6.7%). No detectable differences in death were shown between
the study groups at 28 and 90 days. Patients who had surgery up to one month prior to study eligibility were
not included in this study, so these results should not be applied to surgical critically ill patients. However, the
results of this trial question the need to measure GRVs as a method to reduce aspiration pneumonia in all
critically ill patients. Due to the absence of harm and the potential reduction in nursing resources needed to
monitor patients, we suggest against routine monitoring of GRVs in all patients with sepsis unless the patient
has demonstrated feeding intolerance (e.g., vomiting, reflux of feeds into the oral cavity) or for patients who
are considered to be at high risk for aspiration (e.g., surgery, hemodynamic instability). We recommend the
generation of further evidence through the conduct of future randomized controlled trials targeted to higherrisk patient groups such as the surgical population or those in shock to determine the threshold and frequency
with which GRVs should be monitored.


Feeding intolerance is defined as vomiting, aspiration of gastric contents, or high GRVs. For multiple reasons,
feeding intolerance commonly develops in critically ill patients. Patients with pre-existing gastroparesis or
diabetes or those who are receiving sedatives and vasopressors are at risk. Prokinetic agents, including
metoclopramide, domperidone, and erythromycin, are frequently used in the ICU. Each of these agents has
different pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties; however, these agents may be associated with
prolongation of QT interval and ventricular arrhythmias. A large case-control study in non-ICU patients showed
a threefold increase in risk of sudden cardiac death with domperidone use at doses > 30 mg/day (604). Another
retrospective cohort study showed that outpatient use of erythromycin is associated with a twofold increase in
the risk of sudden cardiac death, especially if concomitantly used with other CYP3A inhibitors (605). The impact
on ventricular arrhythmias in ICU patients is less clear.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **119**


A recent systematic review and meta-analysis included 13 RCTs enrolling 1,341 critically ill patients showed that
prokinetic agent use was associated with lower risk of feeding intolerance (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55–0.97; moderatequality evidence). This was equivalent to an absolute risk reduction of 17%. The use of prokinetic agents did
not significantly increase mortality (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81–1.1; low-quality evidence); however, the incidence
of fatal or nonfatal cardiac arrhythmias was not consistently reported across studies. There was no significant
effect on the risk of pneumonia or vomiting. The majority of trials examined the effect of metoclopramide or
erythromycin; subgroup analysis by drug class was underpowered to detect important subgroup differences
(606). We considered the desirable consequences (lower risk of feeding intolerance) and the low quality of
evidence showing no difference in mortality or pneumonia, and issued a weak recommendation for using
prokinetic agents (metoclopramide or erythromycin) to treat feeding intolerance in patients with sepsis. Future
large comparative trials are needed to determine the relative efficacy and safety of different agents.


Monitoring the QT interval with serial electrocardiograms is required when these agents are used in the ICU,
especially if concomitantly used with other agents that could prolong the QT interval (607). The need for
prokinetic agents should be assessed daily, and they should be stopped when clinically not indicated.


Feeding intolerance is defined as vomiting, abdominal distention, or high GRVs that result in interruption of
enteral nutrition. Critically ill patients are at risk of gastroparesis and feeding intolerance; evidence of delayed
gastric emptying can be found in approximately 50% of critically ill patients (608). The proportion of patients
who will progress to develop clinical symptoms is less clear. Feeding intolerance can result in interruption of
nutritional support, vomiting, aspiration of gastric contents, or pneumonia (609). The pathophysiology is not
completely understood and is likely to be multifactorial. Gastroparesis can be caused by pharmacologic agents
that are frequently used in the ICU (e.g., sedatives, opioids, or NMBAs), gastric hypoperfusion in the context of
shock, hyperglycaemia, or vasopressor use (610-612).


Post-pyloric tubes have the theoretical advantage of improving feeding intolerance in patients with gastroparesis,
consequently improving the delivery of nutrition into the gut. Post-pyloric feeding tubes, although safe, are
not always available, and require technical skill for successful insertion. Gastric air insufflation and prokinetic
agents are both effective strategies to facilitate the insertion of post-pyloric tubes in critically ill patients (613).
Endoscopy and an external magnet device can also be used to guide post-pyloric tube insertion, but are not
always available, are expensive, and require a higher level of expertise.


We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials to examine the effect of postpyloric (compared to gastric) feeding on patient-important outcomes. We identified 21 eligible RCTs enrolling
1,579 patients. Feeding via post-pyloric tube reduced the risk of pneumonia compared to gastric tube feeding
(RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59–0.94; low-quality evidence). This translates into a 2.5% (95% CI, 0.6%–4.1%) absolute
reduction in pneumonia risk. However, there was no significant effect on the risk of death, aspiration, or vomiting
(Supplemental Digital Content 16, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C337). This is consistent with the results of older
meta-analyses (614,615). Although the use of post-pyloric tubes reduced risk of pneumonia, the quality of
evidence was low, the magnitude of benefit was small, and there was uncertainty about the effect on other
patient-important outcomes. Cost-effectiveness studies that describe the economic consequences of using postpyloric feeding tubes are lacking. Therefore, we decided that the balance between desirable and undesirable
consequences was unclear in low-risk patients; however, the use of post-pyloric feeding tubes may be justified
in patients at high risk of aspiration (i.e., patients with history of recurrent aspiration, severe gastroparesis,
feeding intolerance, or refractory medical treatment).


Selenium was administered in the hope that it could correct the known reduction of selenium concentration
in sepsis patients and provide a pharmacologic effect through an antioxidant defence. Although some RCTs are
available, the evidence for the use of IV selenium is not convincing. Two recent meta-analyses suggest, with
weak findings, a potential benefit of selenium supplementation in sepsis (616,617). However, a recent large


**120** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



RCT also examined the effect on mortality rates (618). Overall pooled odds ratio (0.94; CI, 0.77–1.15) suggests
no significant impact on mortality with sepsis. Also, no differences in secondary outcomes of development
of nosocomial pneumonia or ICU LOS were found. When updating our meta-analysis to include the results of
this recent study, there was no difference in mortality between both groups (Supplemental Digital Content 17,
http://links.lww.com/CCM/C338).


Arginine availability is reduced in sepsis, which can lead to reduced nitric oxide synthesis, loss of microcirculatory
regulation, and enhanced production of superoxide and peroxynitrite. However, arginine supplementation
could lead to unwanted vasodilation and hypotension (619,620). Human trials of L-arginine supplementation
have generally been small and reported variable effects on mortality (621-624). The only study in septic patients
showed improved survival but had limitations in study design (623). Other studies suggested no benefit or
possible harm in the subgroup of septic patients (621,624,625). Some authors found improvement in secondary
outcomes in septic patients, such as reduced infectious complications and hospital LOS, but the relevance of
these findings in the face of potential harm is unclear.


Glutamine levels are also reduced during critical illness. Exogenous supplementation can improve gut mucosal
atrophy and permeability, possibly leading to reduced bacterial translocation. Other potential benefits are
enhanced immune cell function, decreased proinflammatory cytokine production, and higher levels of
glutathione and antioxidative capacity (619,620). However, the clinical significance of these findings is not
clearly established.


Although a previous meta-analysis showed mortality reduction (626), several other meta-analyses did not (627630). Four recent well-designed studies also failed to show a mortality benefit in the primary analyses, although
none focused specifically on septic patients (631-634). Two small studies on septic patients showed no benefit
in mortality rates (635,636) but showed a significant reduction in infectious complications (636) and a faster
recovery of organ dysfunction.


Massive disruption in energy metabolism contributes to sepsis severity and end organ failure. The magnitude
of the energy shift, and, possibly more importantly, the host’s metabolic adaptiveness to the shift in energy
demand, likely influence patient survival. Carnitine, endogenously manufactured from lysine and methionine, is
required for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria and the generation of energy. As such,
carnitine utilization is essential for enabling the switch from glucose to long-chain fatty acid metabolism during
the sepsis energy crisis. This is the basis for the rationale of employing L-carnitine as a therapeutic in sepsis.
One small, randomized trial in patients with sepsis reported a 28-day mortality decrease in septic shock patients
treated with IV L-carnitine therapy within 24 hours of shock onset; however, the trial was underpowered to
detect such a difference (637). Larger, ongoing trials should provide more evidence of the usefulness of carnitine
supplementation.

| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



**Implementation point 23 - Overall**
Critically ill patients including those with sepsis have complex nutritional needs and require intensive nutritional
input. The importance of recognising different phases of critical illness when considering route, timing and dose
of nutrition support is an essential component of managing nutrition support in individual ICU patients. For
implementation and further details on nutritional care of critically ill patients, see the Critical Care Programme
Intensive Care Nutrition Support Algorithm (CCP,2020).

**Implementation point 24 (Recommendation 79)**
All patients should be screened on admission to ICU to assess their nutrition risk and the need for nutrition
support (Singer et al., 2019) (McClave et al., 2016). This should be followed by a nutritional assessment. See Tables
6 and 7 from the Critical Care Programme Intensive Care Nutrition Support Algorithm (CCP, 2020) for general
principles around early enteral nutrition and guidance on delaying, commencing low dose or commencing early
progressive enteral nutrition.

**Implementation point 25 (Recommendation 80)**
Optimal timing of initiation of parenteral nutrition in ICU patients remains unclear. In light of conflicting evidence,
a pragmatic approach to commencing Parenteral Nutrition (PN) in ICU patients would be to start on day 3-4
when enteral feeding has failed or is contraindicated. Malnourished patients are not represented in available
RCTs, as highlighted above. Consideration should be given to commencing PN earlier than day 7 in patients at
high nutrition risk or severely malnourished, where EN is contraindicated (Singer et al., 2019).

**Implementation Point 26 (Recommendation 84)**
Traditionally in the ICU setting, a measurement of Enteral Nutrition (EN) tolerance using Gastric Residual
Volume (GRV) monitoring is carried out at regular intervals and feed rate is reduced or suspended if levels
are above an agreed cut-off. Abandoning this practice as routine care has been suggested in recent nutrition
support guidelines (McClave et al., 2016). GRV measurement correlates poorly with gastric emptying, as well
as incidence of regurgitation and aspiration and has been shown to contribute to reduce EN delivery. However,
evidence for omission of GRV measurement is largely based on one trial where difficult to feed patients, such
as those with multi-organ failure, and surgical patients were under-represented. For this reason, Canadian
(Nutrition, 2015) and European (Singer et al., 2019) guidelines still recommend a GRV cut off level between
250-500ml and that measurement is done at 4-8 hourly intervals. When EN is established continued monitoring
of GRVs may not be necessary.

**Implementation Point 27 (Recommendation 85)**
Monitoring the QT interval with serial electrocardiograms is required when prokinetic agents are used in the
ICU, especially if concomitantly used with other agents that could prolong the QT interval (607). The need for
prokinetic agents should be assessed daily, and they should be stopped when clinically not indicated.


**Roles and Responsibilities (Implementation points 23-26)**

Clinicians are responsible for engaging dietetics and seeking advice on nutritional management for critically ill
patients.


**3.1.19 Setting goals of care**


**Key questions**

 - In patients with sepsis, should we recommend discussion of goals of care and prognosis with family?

 - In patients with sepsis, should we recommend incorporating palliative and end-of-life care?

 - Should we recommend addressing goals of care early (within 72 hours) during ICU stay?


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **123**


**SSCG Rationale**


Patients with sepsis and multiple organ system failure have a high mortality rate; some will not survive or will have
a poor quality of life. Although the outcome of intensive care treatment in critically ill patients may be difficult
to prognosticate accurately, establishing realistic ICU treatment goals is paramount (638), especially because
inaccurate expectations about prognosis are common among surrogates (639). Nonbeneficial ICU advanced
life-prolonging treatment is not consistent with setting goals of care (640, 641). Models for structuring initiatives
to enhance care in the ICU highlight the importance of incorporating goals of care, along with prognosis, into
treatment plans (642). The use of proactive family care conferences to identify advance directives and treatment
goals within 72 hours of ICU admission has been demonstrated to promote communication and understanding
between the patient’s family and the treating team; improve family satisfaction; decrease stress, anxiety, and
depression in surviving relatives; facilitate end-of-life decision-making; and shorten ICU LOS for patients who
die in the ICU (643, 644). Promoting shared-decision-making with patients and families is beneficial in ensuring
appropriate care in the ICU and that futile care is avoided (641, 645, 646).


Palliative care is increasingly accepted as an essential component of comprehensive care for critically ill patients
regardless of diagnosis or prognosis (642, 647). Use of palliative care in the ICU enhances the ability to recognize
pain and distress; establish the patient’s wishes, beliefs, and values, and their impact on decision-making;
develop flexible communication strategies; conduct family meetings and establish goals of care; provide family
support during the dying process; help resolve team conflicts; and establish reasonable goals for life support
and resuscitation (648).


A recent systematic review of the effect of palliative care interventions and advanced care planning on ICU
utilization identified that, despite wide variation in study type and quality among nine randomized control
trials and 13 nonrandomized controlled trials, patients who received advance care planning or palliative care
interventions consistently showed a pattern toward decreased ICU admissions and reduced ICU LOS (649).


However, significant inter-hospital variation in ratings and delivery of palliative care is consistent with prior
studies showing variation in intensity of care at the end of life (650). Despite differences in geographic location,
legal system, religion, and culture, there is worldwide professional consensus for key end-of-life practices in the
ICU (651).


Promoting patient and family-centred care in the ICU has emerged as a priority and includes implementation of
early and repeated care conferencing to reduce family stress and improve consistency in communication; open
flexible visitation; family presence during clinical rounds, resuscitation, and invasive procedures; and attention
to cultural and spiritual support (652–655).


**Recommendation 91.** (SSCG Section U, Recommendation 1).
We recommend that goals of care and prognosis be discussed with patients and families.
**Quality/level of evidence: Low** **+ Strength of recommendation: BPS**

**Recommendation 92.** (SSCG Section U, Recommendation 2).
We recommend that goals of care be incorporated into treatment and end-of-life care planning, utilizing
palliative care principles where appropriate.
**Quality/level of evidence: Moderate** **+ Strength of recommendation: Strong**

**Recommendation 93.** (SSCG Section U, Recommendation 3).
We suggest that goals of care be addressed as early as feasible, but no later than within 72 hours of ICU
admission.
**Quality/level of evidence: Low** **+ Strength of recommendation: Weak**

**3.2 Rehabilitation and post-discharge care**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



The evidence base behind the benefits of structured rehabilitation for post sepsis patients is still evolving and
further research is on-going. A summary of the findings to date with suggested good practice points are outlined
below. These good practice points are divided in hospital practices aimed at preventing long-term morbidity,
and post-hospital discharge strategies designed to screen, evaluate and manage clinical conditions among sepsis
survivors.


**Hospital practices for preventing long-term morbidity:**

The GDG recognises that the good practice points for hospital practices below are already current practice and
anticipates that no additional funding will be required for implementing in a more standardised way.

 - Awareness of the long-term sequelae of sepsis and septic shock should be promoted amongst healthcare
providers, patients and/or next of kin.

 - Mobilisation and physical rehabilitation should start as early as clinically possible during hospital stay, basing
rehabilitation goals on the clinical assessment of healthcare professionals experienced in critical care and
rehabilitation.

 - The approach to sepsis patients admitted to the ICU should align with international practice guidelines for
the management of pain, agitation, delirium and sleep disruption.

 - Sepsis information booklets should be made available to the relatives and friends of patients admitted to a
critical care area with sepsis. The latest version can be downloaded from https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/
who/cspd/ncps/sepsis/resources/

 - The option of starting a diary should be considered.

 - Pre-discharge assessment of sepsis patients should include checking for ongoing dietetics, physiotherapy
and psychosocial requirements and referral for community follow-up based on their clinical need.

 - Pre-discharge medication reconciliation.

 - The discharge letter provided to Primary Care Physicians should include ongoing dietetic, physiotherapy
and psychosocial requirements as well as hospital diagnoses, treatment and ongoing medication.


Post-hospital discharge strategies for assessment and management of clinical sequelae
The GDG recognises that additional funding will be required to implement the good practice points for posthospital discharge outlined below. However, these good practice points support the Government policy direction
for Ireland’s healthcare system - Slaintecare (DOH, 2017b) and should be considered as part of the expansion
of capacity to deliver healthcare closer to the patient in the community.

 - The utilisation of a structured clinical evaluation method such as the ‘Framework for evaluating and treating
patients in the 90 days after hospitalization for sepsis’ (Prescott and Angus, 2018), aimed at screening for
common mental and physical impairments after sepsis at outpatient clinic review post discharge or by GP’s.

 - Individualising protocols of physical rehabilitation aimed at improving function in activities of daily living
(ADL), functional exercise capacity, aerobic capacity, and skeletal muscle strength, with focus on respiratory
muscles.

 - Self-management practices and peer-support as valuable resources to mitigate mental health impairments.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **125**


**Rationale:**
A recent meta-analysis of epidemiological studies estimated yearly worldwide hospital survival after sepsis to be
as high as 73% (Fleischmann et al., 2016). A considerable proportion of sepsis survivors, however, manifest an
increased likelihood of long-term morbidity when compared to matched cohorts (Iwashyna et al., 2010) (Shah
et al., 2013) (Yende et al., 2014) (Zielske et al., 2014) (Prescott et al., 2015) (Ou et al., 2016). Common long-term
sequelae after sepsis include the following: cognitive impairment with decline in cognitive functions such as
verbal fluency, memory and attention, and executive functioning; deterioration of mental health status related
to depression (Davydow et al., 2013) (Rabiee et al., 2016), anxiety (Nikayin et al., 2016), and post-traumatic
stress disorder (Wintermann et al., 2015) (Parker et al., 2015); physical disabilities that result in swallowing
difficulties (Zielske et al., 2014) and functional limitations of activities of daily living (ADLs) (Iwashyna et al.,
2010); increased predisposition to recurrent infections (Prescott et al., 2015) (Shen et al., 2016) ; progression and
aggravation of chronic medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (Prescott et al., 2015); and occurrence of acute or acute-on-chronic events such
as myocardial infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death (Zielske et al., 2014) (Ou et al., 2016).
Overall, a combination of long-term sequelae often results in a reduction of physical and psychological quality of
life among sepsis survivors (Winters et al., 2010) (Yende et al., 2016). Importantly, performance in the workplace
may decrease, and social interactions may be subtly undermined (Davydow et al., 2013).


Given these considerable human and socioeconomic implications, it is necessary to define a conceptual
framework of practices aimed at reducing long-term morbidity in septic patients (Prescott and Angus, 2018).
As a general paradigm, recovery after sepsis could be enhanced by adopting both hospital practices aimed
at preventing long-term morbidity, and post-hospital discharge strategies designed to screen, evaluate and
manage clinical conditions among sepsis survivors (Prescott and Angus, 2018) (Prescott and Costa, 2018).


Among the hospital practices for preventing long-term morbidity, we recognise the importance of adhering to
international practice guidelines for the management of pain, agitation and delirium in ICU, and to perform
early mobilisation and physical rehabilitation as early as clinically possible.
Pain, agitation and delirium are common complications among sepsis patients admitted to the ICU and are
associated with extended ICU length of stay and increased risk of developing neuropathic pain, cognitive
impairment, and post-traumatic stress disorder (Barr et al., 2013) Implementation of care bundles recommended
by clinical practice guidelines could improve clinical outcomes in this domain (Mansouri et al., 2013) (Trogrlić et
al., 2015).


A recent Cochrane review on the effects of early mobilisation for critically ill adults concluded that the evidence
for the effectiveness of such practices for short-term clinical outcomes is inconsistent and uncertain (Doiron et
al., 2018). Despite the majority of published RCTs showed improvement in short-term physical and neurological
outcomes, their quality of evidence is low to moderate due to small sample sizes, lack of blinding of participants
and personnel, variation in the interventions and outcomes used to measure their effect and inadequate
descriptions of the interventions delivered as usual care (Doiron et al., 2018). Moreover, no RCTs provide high
quality evidence on the effectiveness of early mobilisation during ICU stay in reducing the long-term risk of
acquiring physical and mental disabilities after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, given the positive results of
most studies and the strong theoretical rationale for benefit, we recommend performing mobilisation and
physical rehabilitation as early as clinically possible. In agreement with the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence guidelines, rehabilitation goals should be patient-specific, and based on the clinical assessment
of healthcare professionals experienced in critical care and rehabilitation (NICE, 2017) (NICE, 2009).


Among the post-hospital discharge strategies for assessment and management of clinical sequelae we recognise
the importance of clinical follow-up of sepsis survivors, including the adoption of a structured clinical evaluation
method aimed at screening for common mental and physical impairments after sepsis. We also recognise the
role of individualised protocols of physical rehabilitation and self-management practices and peer-support as
valuable resources to mitigate mental health impairments.


**126** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



To date, very little research has focused on strategies to improve rehabilitation after hospital discharge specifically
among sepsis survivors. One retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study of sepsis survivors showed
that engaging in rehabilitation within 90 days of hospital discharge was associated with a significantly lower
risk of 10-year mortality (Chao et al., 2014). In that study, rehabilitation consisted of individualised protocols
constructed by physicians and psychiatrists and delivered by a multidisciplinary team which included physical
and/or occupational therapists, speech therapists, social workers, and/or athletic trainers. These protocols
were patient-specific, and aimed at improving muscle strengthening and movement, activities of daily living,
cardiovascular capacity, functional ability, and occupational and communication therapy (Chao et al., 2014).
Only one RCT was designed to examine the effects of specific primary care-based interventions on longterm quality of life after sepsis (Schmidt et al., 2016). Such interventions included education for primary care
physicians and patients about long-term disabilities after sepsis, case management provided by trained nurses,
and clinical decision-making support for primary care physicians provided by consulting physicians. Of all the
outcomes measured, marginal positive findings were noted on functional outcomes such as physical function
and disability at 6 months, ADL limitations at 6 and 12 months, and quality of sleep at 12 months. Despite the
paucity of high-quality evidence for rehabilitation among sepsis survivors, indirect evidence can be derived from
the literature on rehabilitation from critical illness (Mehlhorn et al., 2014), as many of the clinical sequelae after
sepsis have been associated to the ICU stay. In this field, interventions proposed in different low-quality RCTs
have yielded inconsistent findings regarding a beneficial effect on functional exercise capacity, or on healthrelated quality of life, of an exercise-based intervention initiated after ICU discharge for survivors of critical
illness (Connolly et al., 2015) .
Peer support groups for ICU survivors have been recently proposed as a strategy to relieve psychological distress
(Mikkelsen et al., 2016) and ICU diaries have been shown to reduce PTSD symptoms among patients and
caregivers (Jones et al., 2010) (Jones et al., 2012) .


ICUsteps Dublin is a voluntary support group open to former intensive care patients, family and carers. Informal
“drop-in” meetings facilitated by former patients, relatives and ICU nurses are held one evening every 8 weeks
where people recovering from critical illness can share experiences and lend support to one another. (www.
icusteps.ie).

**3.3 Summary budget impact analysis**

**Methodology**
The guideline development group systematically reviewed all 93 recommendations to determine if any had a
budget impact for the implementation of the guideline update. Each recommendation statement was discussed
and determined as either having no budget impact if the recommendation was currently practiced, or as having
a requirement for a budget resource. The costs were then determined for the latter. Michelle O’Neill (HIQA)
and Susan Ahern (HIQA) both with expertise in health economics were consulted to inform this section of the
guideline.


**Key findings relating to costs**
Only 1 of 93 recommendations was determined to have a potential budgetary impact. In addition, the GDG
suggest that research be undertaken to determine the burden of chronic sequelae associated with sepsis
survival. However as this is a suggestion, it has not been included in the analysis.


**Recommendation 1:** Hospitals and hospital systems have a performance improvement programme for sepsis
including sepsis screening for acutely ill high-risk patients.


**Recommendation 1 - Budget Impact**
The areas identified under recommendation 1 as having a budget impact for development are:
**a. National Sepsis Programme Costs**
**b. National Quality Assurance and Improvement System (NQAIS) Sepsis**
**c. Data extraction and analysis – Annual Report**
**d. Sepsis Education**
**e. Raising Awareness**
**i. Clinical – Sepsis Summit**
**ii. General Public – Sepsis Awareness**


**A) National Sepsis Programme Costs**

A performance improvement programme for hospitals at both group and local level is provided by the
National Sepsis Programme with the provision of audits and education to improve performance in the
recognition and management of sepsis.

The fixed costs due to salary contribute to over 85% of the programme’s costs. See table 20 for the
breakdown of costs.

**B) NQAIS Sepsis**

NQAIS Clinical is a web-enabled feedback tool based on HIPE Data which would have the potential to be
developed for Sepsis. Development of NQAIS SEPSIS would allow up to date national and local level data
and would promote earlier detection of negative trends so that action can be taken sooner to improve any
deficiencies in the early recognition and management of sepsis and therefore would enable performance
improvement and improve patient safety. NQAIS Clinical could have the potential to:

    - Improve audit and quality improvement initiatives that impact on patient safety.

    - Save resources for the QID and Sepsis teams to allow more time for training and awareness.

    - Provide clinical leadership with comparative performance metrics for the objective management of
sepsis patients.

    - Support the development of National Key Performance indicators for sepsis.

    - Allow individual hospitals to view the national picture, hospital group and individual hospital
discharge activity by diagnosis group, procedure group or specialty group.

    - The NQAIS sepsis mortality prediction model and scoring system could facilitate comparison of age
and co-morbidity adjusted hospital sepsis-associated mortality rates nationally and internationally
and will provide real time data to the system.


The costs are outlined in Table 21.


**C) Data extraction and analysis – Sepsis Annual Report**

The publication of the annual National Sepsis Report aims to highlight the burden of sepsis to the community
and to the healthcare system. It has allowed the monitoring of the impact of National Clinical Guideline No.
6: Sepsis Management and its implementation and will continue to perform this function with the update
in 2021. The report also facilitates a review of the trends in the detection and reporting of sepsis along with
the mortality rate in the adult, maternity and paediatric setting. The publication of the annual sepsis report
is an important document for the monitoring of the recognition and detection of Sepsis nationally. It is used


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **129**


by various hospital groups and sepsis committees as a reference. Whilst sepsis occurs in all age groups and
all sectors of society, it most commonly occurs in the extremes of age and in individuals with co-morbidities.
The report shows the pattern of sepsis incidence in Ireland and informs on the characteristics of individuals
who are at an increased risk both of developing sepsis and of dying from sepsis. This allows heightened
vigilance for sepsis amongst these individuals and provides evidence to support the use of preventative
strategies, such as vaccination, in these at-risk people.


The costs are outlined in Table 21.


**D) Sepsis education – E-Learning Module.**

Currently there is an e-learning module for Sepsis which is housed on HSeLanD that was developed
previously by the National Sepsis programme. This programme requires updating to reflect current best
practice as outlined in this guideline. This programme is aimed at all HSE clinical staff in acute and maternity
hospital settings.


The costs are outlined in Table 21.


**E) Raising awareness**


**a. Sepsis Summit**

The Sepsis Summits is a valuable learning opportunity where members of sepsis committees, senior
leaders and managers in the acute sector, primary healthcare and maternity come together to focus
on the learning and sharing of information around implementing the National Clinical Guideline No.
26 Sepsis Management for Adults (including maternity). International speakers are invited to share
learning from other countries. The summit also allows a forum for networking and national support
for all those implementing the sepsis tools with a main aim being to ensure that sepsis remains a
priority on all hospital organisations agenda.


**b. Public Campaign**

A public awareness campaign aims to provide the general public with the tools to recognise the
signs of sepsis and seek early medical interventation. The Sepsis programme will seek funding to
promote sepsis awareness education to the public and also to Primary Care Facilities. Funding
will pay for printing and distribution of sepsis education promotional material, i.e. make available
patient information booklets to the general public; link with Healthy Ireland and communications
dept. HSE; launch community awareness campaign & supporting leaflets/social media at GP
surgeries, CHO pharmacies, primary healthcare centres. Social media should be used to target GP
surgeries, schools and sporting events.


The costs are outlined in Table 21.

**Conclusion**

The budget impact analysis considers the additional resources required to implement the updated Sepsis
Management National Clinical Guideline No 26. Over 5 years, the budget impact of the guideline recommendations
is estimated to be €3,533,680 including staff costs. This is illustrated in Table 22.

It is also important to consider the cost savings that have been realised through the implementation of the guideline
to date as demonstrated by the National Sepsis mortality data reported annually.


The mean in-hospital crude mortality rate for in-patients with a diagnosis of sepsis from 2011-2015 showed
an average of 23.4% (NSR, 2016). For the period 2016-2018 (NSR 2017,2018,2019), this dropped to 18.7%
representing a statistically significant improvement since the publication of the National Clinical Guideline (NCEC
2014). The mortality decrease suggests an additional 302 lives saved over the 3 years post implementation from
this subpopulation.


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **131**


In 2018 in Ireland, 4,002 patients admitted to ICU had a sepsis code on their hospital discharge. The hospital AvLOS
for this subgroup decreased from 36.72 days in 2011-15 to 33.7 days in 2016-18, a gain of 12,086 bed days and a
reduction in direct costs from €30,808 to €29,589 per patient. This represents a saving of €10.6million based on
cost per day of €878 (Health Pricing Office, 2017), between 2011 and 2018.
**3.4 Areas for Future Health Research**

Many areas for future research are identified throughout the SSCG. This section serves to highlight these
recommendations to inform future guideline updates on how to best manage sepsis in Ireland and to add to the
existing knowledge base.


**•** **Initial Treatment**
The use of IV fluids in the resuscitation of patients is a cornerstone of modern therapy. Despite this, there is
little available evidence from RCTs to support its practice; this is an area in which research is urgently needed.

**•** **Vasoactive Medications**
Phenylephrine is a pure α-adrenergic agonist. Clinical trial data in sepsis are limited. Phenylephrine has
the potential to produce splanchnic vasoconstriction (280). A network meta-analysis resulted in imprecise
estimates (wide confidence intervals) when phenylephrine was compared to other vasopressors (281).
Therefore, the impact on clinical outcomes is uncertain, and phenylephrine use should be limited until more
research is available.

**•** **Blood purification techniques**
The confidence in the evidence around blood purification techniques is very low either in favour of or against
blood purification techniques; and as such they do not provide any recommendation but suggest further
research is needed to clarify the clinical benefit of blood purification techniques.

**•** **Renal Replacement therapy**
More research is required on the effect of dose of CRRT. A meta-analysis of the sepsis patients included in
all relevant RCTs (n = 1,505) did not demonstrate any significant relationship between dose and mortality;
the point estimate, however, favours CRRT doses > 30 mL/kg/hr. Because of risk of bias, inconsistency, and
imprecision, confidence in the estimate is very low with further research is indicated.

**•** **Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis**
Combined pharmacologic prophylaxis and mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression
(IPC) and/or graduated compression stockings (GCS) is a potential option in critically ill patients with sepsis and
septic shock. There are currently no high-quality studies of this approach in septic patients, or even critically
ill patients in general, exist; however, further research is ongoing.

**•** **Nutrition**
In summary, due to the lack of mortality benefit, the increased risk of infection, and the extra cost for parenteral
nutrition in the absence of clinical benefit (568), current evidence does not support the initiation of early
parenteral nutrition over the first 7 days of care for patients with contraindications or intolerance to enteral
nutrition. Specific patient groups may benefit more or incur more harm with early initiation of parenteral
nutrition in this context. Future research should be encouraged according to individual patient level metaanalyses to characterize these subgroups and plan for future randomized trials.

**•** **Rehabilitation**
Among the post-hospital discharge strategies for assessment and management of clinical sequelae importance
of clinical follow-up of sepsis survivors is recognised including the adoption of a structured clinical evaluation
method aimed at screening for common mental and physical impairments after sepsis. The role of individualised
protocols for physical rehabilitation and self-management practices and peer-support as valuable resources to
mitigate mental health impairments are also recognised. To date, very little research has focused on strategies
to improve rehabilitation after hospital discharge specifically among sepsis survivors and the GDG suggest that
research be undertaken to determine the burden of chronic sequelae associated with sepsis survival.

**Appendix 1: Guideline Development Group Terms of Reference**


**Guideline Development Group**
**Terms of Reference**
**1. Purpose**

The purpose of this Adult Guideline Development Group (GDG) is to update the existing NCG No.6 (Sepsis
management) (November2014) to reflect current best evidence.


**2. Objectives**

The objectives of the GDG are to:

  - Ensure adherence to the NCEC methodology in drafting the revised clinical guideline.

  - Include a budget impact analysis in the updated guideline.

  - Review current guidelines in peer reviewed journals since 2015 with a view to adopting or adapting a
guideline.

  - Include an implementation strategy in the revised guideline.

  - Prepare a draft updated guideline.

  - Circulate draft guideline for consultation and external review.

  - Finalise and approve the updated clinical guideline.

  - Submit to National Sepsis Steering Group for review and approval.

  - Submit finalised updated guideline to NPSO/NCEC, DOH for appraisal, endorsement and ministerial
launch.


**3. Scope**

The scope of the GDG is to revise and update the existing NCG No.6 (Sepsis Management Guideline)
(2014) to reflect current best practice utilising Irish national data. The GDG will be cognisant of this
throughout the guideline revision process and will consider adapting, adopting current guidelines or
making recommendations based on a current literature review.


**4. Membership**

Membership nominations were sought from a wide range of experts so as to be as representative of
all the relevant key stakeholders. The GDG may on occasion co-opt expertise from relevant sources as
required.


**5. Working Arrangements**

a) A schedule of meetings will be agreed with the Chair for the year. Work will be undertaken between
meetings and members will contribute to, and approve work, via e-mail correspondence (and
teleconference when available).


| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2 **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)** **133**


b) The Chair and Deputy Chair will be responsible for circulating papers and minutes of meetings. Papers
for meetings will be circulated no later than 3 working days before meetings and minutes will be
circulated no later than 2 weeks after meetings.

c) The group will be quorate if a third of total membership (8) are present.

d) Apologies should be sent in advance of meetings. If a group member does not attend more than
three consecutive meetings the Chair or Deputy Chair will contact him/her to seek confirmation of
continued participation or if they would like to nominate a replacement.

e) Members of the GDG will reflect the views of the specialist groups and individual organisations they
represent and will communicate through the relevant organisation’s governance structures.

f) Decision-making: the agenda will identify items that require important decisions to be made at the
meeting. Where group members are unable to attend, they may submit comments to the Chair/
Deputy, by e-mail, by 5pm on the day prior to the meeting. The Chair/Deputy will bring forward all
comments received for consideration by the group in attendance. Decisions will be made by the
group attending the meeting. Meeting notes will detail such decisions to group members who are not
in attendance.

g) There may be a requirement to establish various working groups to advance actions as guideline
development progresses. The Chair of the working group will report to the GDG on progress and
outputs and seek further advice or decisions where appropriate.

**Appendix 3: Glossary of terms and abbreviations**


**Glossary of Terms**


The HSE has issued a Code of Practice for Healthcare Records management which includes dosage abbreviation
guidance which is available at the following link:


htps://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/qid/quality-and-patent-safety-documents/abbreviatons.pdf


**Clinician:** a registered nursing/midwifery, medical or health and social care professional.

**Confusion (new):** new onset confusion, acutely altered mental status or delirium.

**Escalation of Care:** the point at which a clinician successfully contacts/calls for a more senior clinical review nursing or medical - of a patient.

**EMEWS:** a standardised Emergency Medicine early warning system to recognise and respond to clinical
deterioration in adult patients in the ED waiting room, following Triage.

**EWS:** Early Warning System

**Irish National Early Warning System (INEWS):** a system which incorporates anticipation of deterioration,
recognition, escalation, response and governance.

**Irish Maternity Early Warning System (IMEWS):** a system for pregnant women which incorporates anticipation
of deterioration, recognition, escalation, response and governance.

**Maternal sespsis** is a life threatening condition defined as organ dysfunction resulting from infection during
pregnancy, childbirth, post-abortion or postpartum (WHO 2017).

**Screening:** the purpose of screening is to identify patients with a high-risk presentation e.g. clinically apparent
acute organ dysfunction such as acute confusion, respiratory failure or a purpuric rash AND patients who because
of their medical history, e.g. on chemotherapy or having chronic co-morbidities/additional factors, have a high
mortality risk if they have sepsis.

**Sepsis** is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

**Septic Shock** is a subset of sepsis with circulatory and celluar/metabolic dysfunction associated with a higher
risk of mortailty (Singer et al., 2016)

 - The sepsis definition taskforce has defined this as the requiremnt for vasopressors/inotropes to achieve a
mean arterial pressure of ≥ 65mmHg AND a lactate >2mmols/l despite adequate fluid resuscitation

**SIRS:** Systemic Inflammatory Reponse Syndrome

**SEPSIS 1:** First CCP/SCCM consensus definition 1991

**SESPIS 2:** Second CCP/SCCM consensus definition 2001

**SEPSIS 3:** Third CCP/SCCM consensus definition 2016 (Updated 2018)

**SEPSIS 6** is the name given to a bundle of medical therapies designed to reduce mortality in patients with sepsis
(Take 3 and Give 3). Sepsis 6 was developed by The UK Sepsis Trust (Daniels, Nutbeam & Laver, 2006) as a
practical tool to help healthcare professionals deliver the SSCG 1 hour bundle.


**138** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**


**SEPSIS 6+1:** (+ 1 = Fetal wellbeing)



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



Resuscitating the mother will resuscitate the baby, however, it is important to assess fetal wellbeing and formulate
a plan for delivery if required. Maternal sepsis with or without haemodynamic instability may present with fetal
distress as the uteroplacental circulation is not auto-regulated (Chau, 2014). Thus, any maternal circulatory
insufficiency arising from sepsis may result in compromised fetal perfusion.

**Time zero:** 1 hour is allowed for screening and medical review from trigger. If infection is included in the
differential diagnosis following medical review and the patient is in one of the at-risk groups, this is TIME ZERO.
All elements of the Sepsis 6 bundle are to be initiated within 1 hour of TIME ZERO.

**Trigger:** **The trigger to prompt sepsis screening**

 - Emergency Department (ED) presents unwell due to suspected infection

 - In-patient: deteriorates on the ward due to suspected infection, deterioration on the ward is suggested
by a INEWS score that has risen to ≥ 4 (≥ 5 if already on supplementary oxygen therapy) (NCEC, 2013) or
by exercising clinical judgment.
The patient should be screened to see if they fit into one of the high-risk groups and escalated to medical review
as per the ‘Think Sepsis at Triage’ algorithm or the INEWS escalation and response protocol.

The economic literature review was undertaken using the same search terms as derived from the clinical
literature review but with the economic filter applied. A systematic search for evidence relating to the costeffectiveness of implementing sepsis protocols similar to the guideline was carried out. After the search 14
full text articles were reviewed but none were considered applicable and therefore were not referenced. This
strategy is outlined in Table 23 and Figure 16.

**Appendix 5: The Coding Process**

The source document for coding in Ireland for HIPE is the medical record or chart. The clinical coder uses the
entire chart to extract the conditions and procedures to provide a complete record of the patient and their
health care encounter. The clinical coder, the person who translates medical terminology into alphanumeric
code, performs an essential function in providing quality, accurate, and uniform medical information and greatly
contributes to the continuous growth of medical knowledge and data. In addition to the discharge summary
or letter, additional documentation referenced for coding a case include nursing notes, consultation reports,
progress notes, operative reports, pre- and post-operative reports, pathology reports and more recently the
sepsis screening form.


Fully completed and signed sepsis screening forms greatly assist in the coding and recognition of sepsis in acute
hospitals. The classification used is ICD-10-AM/ACHI/ACS 8th Edition (International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision, Australian Modification/ Australian Classification of Health Interventions/Australian Coding
Standards). The Australian Coding Standards have to be adhered to by clinical coders in their work. These are
complemented by the Irish Coding Standards (ICS). The ICS are developed to complement the Australian Coding
Standards (ACS) and are revised regularly to reflect changing clinical practice.


ACS 0010 General Abstraction Guidelines states that coders cannot infer diagnoses from laboratory results and
that “The listing of diagnoses on the front sheet and/or the discharge summary of the clinical record is the
responsibility of the clinician”. It further states, “Unless a clinician can indicate that a test result is significant
and/or indicates the relationship between an unclear test result and a condition, such test results should not
be coded”.


The diagnosis of sepsis and documentation of the underlying cause by the medical team, if known, allows for
greater specificity in coding.


All HIPE data are keyed in at the hospital using the HIPE Portal data entry system that runs an extensive number
of validation edit checks to ensure the quality of the data. Other data quality activities and data quality tools are
in use at local and national HPO level.


**148** **|** **Sepsis Management for adults (including maternity)**


**Appendix 6: Literature search strategy**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



A literature search was undertaken by the HSE Library Service to identify any national and international sepsis
clinical guidelines published since the previous Sepsis NCG was published in 2014 which could be adopted or
adapted for use in the Irish Healthcare setting.


The database searches are outlined in Table 24 and the search strategy using search terms related to the
management of sepsis and septic shock and guidelines are shown in table 25. The websites of key organisations
were also searched.


N.B A change in clinical leadership and programme manager position in 2018 in the National Sepsis Programme
resulted in a delay in the progression of the guideline. The GDG were reconvened and in June 2019 the literature
search was repeated to ensure that there were no additional publications in the interim period.

The subsequent search in 2019 identified no additional guidelines in relation to Sepsis Management that had
not been identified in 2014. The search identified 11 documents, 8 of which were excluded immediately as they
related to pre-hospital care, non-acute care settings, paediatrics or were related to a specific type of sepsis,
e.g. acute meningitis and meningococcal sepsis. When the exclusion criteria were applied only three guidelines
were eligible for consideration:

 - NICE Sepsis: recognition, assessment and early management (2016)

 - Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC): International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock
(2016)

 - The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock (2018)


**AGREE II Tool**

In order to decide which guideline was relevant for the Irish Healthcare system and to appraise the quality of the
guidelines, including the rigour and transparency in which the guidelines were developed a quality assessment
was undertaken by two of the GDG Members using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II
(AGREE II) tool, (Brouwers et al., 2010). The SSC Guideline ranked highest in all domains by both appraisers with
overall domain percentages ranging 71-100%. Both appraisers agreed that based on the AGREE II process that
the SSC Guideline should be adopted for use in the Irish Healthcare system.

**Appendix 8: Implementation plan**



| National Clinical Guideline No. 26 V2



These guidelines are divided into sections with each one pertaining to a different aspect of patient care.
Implementation points are included to guide implementation of the SSCG recommendations in Ireland,
particularly in the non-critical care environment.


While the implementation plan is specific to the individual recommendations in the guideline, some actions will
assist with guideline implementation as a whole. These include the role of the Sepsis ADONS and engagement
with hospital sepsis committees to ensure dissemination and communication of the updated guideline. The
National Sepsis Programme will work with HSE communications both internally and externally to inform key
stakeholders of the Sepsis Management – National Clinical Guideline No. 26 update and to provide support as
appropriate. The Annual Sepsis Summit will also be used as a platform to disseminate the updated guideline.
The sepsis e-learning module update further supports the updated National Clinical Guideline and will continue
to be available through HSeLanD.


The implementation of the Sepsis Management National Clinical Guideline No. 26 (2021) is dependent on
various factors. Table 26 identifies the enablers and barriers to implementing the recommendations along with
the responsibilities and timelines. See also the Logic model illustrated in Table 27.

**Appendix 12: PHECC practitioner screening and treatment CPG for Sepsis**

This algorithm applies to patients with clinical signs of tissue hypoperfusion where infection is suspected to
be the cause. The focus of care is to ‘give three’; oxygen, IV fluids and antimicrobials, however the latter two
are within the scope of practice of advanced paramedics only. The EMT and paramedic therefore will request
advanced paramedic back-up to maximise the care of patients presenting with suspected sepsis.
